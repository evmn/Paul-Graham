                May 2004<br><br><i>
                  (This essay was originally published in <a
                    href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0596006624/104-0572701-7443937">Hackers

                </i><br><br>If you wanted to get rich, how would you do it? I think your best
                bet would be to start or join a startup. That's been a
                reliable way to get rich for hundreds of years. The word "startup"
                dates from the 1960s, but what happens in one is
                very similar to the venture-backed trading voyages of the
                Middle Ages.<br><br>Startups usually involve technology, so much so that the phrase
                "high-tech startup" is almost redundant. A startup is a small
                company that takes on a hard technical problem.<br><br>Lots of people get rich knowing nothing more than
                that.
                You don't have to know physics to be a good pitcher. But
                I think it could give you an edge to understand the underlying principles.
                Why do startups have to be small?
                Will a startup inevitably stop being a startup as it
                grows larger?
                And why do they so often work on
                developing new technology? Why are there so many startups
                selling new drugs or computer software, and none selling corn oil
                or laundry detergent?<br><br><b>The Proposition</b><br><br>Economically, you can think of a startup as a
                way to
                compress your whole working life into a few years. Instead
                of working at a low intensity for forty years, you work as
                hard as you possibly can for four. This pays especially well
                in technology, where you earn a premium for working fast.<br><br>Here is a brief sketch of the economic
                proposition. If you're
                a good hacker in your mid twenties, you can
                get a job paying about $80,000 per year. So on average
                such a hacker must be
                able to do at least $80,000 worth of work per year for the
                company just to break even. You could probably
                work twice as many hours as a corporate employee, and if
                you focus you can probably get three times as much done in
                an hour.

                You should get another multiple of two, at
                least, by eliminating the drag
                of the pointy-haired middle
                manager who would be your boss in a big company.
                Then there is one more multiple: how much smarter are you
                than your job description expects you to be?
                Suppose another multiple of three. Combine all these multipliers, and I'm
                claiming you could be 36 times more
                productive than you're expected to be in a random corporate
                job.

                  </a>]</font>
                If a fairly good hacker is worth $80,000 a year at a
                big company, then a smart
                hacker working very hard without any corporate
                bullshit to slow him down should be able to do work worth about
                $3 million a year.<br><br>Like all back-of-the-envelope calculations, this one
                has a lot of wiggle room. I wouldn't try to
                defend the actual numbers. But I stand by the
                structure of the calculation. I'm not claiming
                the multiplier is precisely 36, but it is certainly more
                than 10, and probably rarely as high as 100.<br><br>If $3 million a year seems
                high, remember that we're talking about the limit case:
                the case where you not only have zero leisure time
                but indeed work so hard that you endanger your health.<br><br>Startups are not magic. They don't change
                the laws of
                wealth creation. They just represent a point at the far end of the curve.
                There is a conservation law at work here: if
                you want to make a million dollars, you have to endure a
                million dollars' worth of pain.
                For example, one way to
                make a million dollars would be to work for the
                Post Office your whole life, and save every penny of your
                salary. Imagine the stress of working for the Post
                Office for fifty years. In a startup you compress all
                this stress into three or four years. You do tend to get a
                certain
                bulk discount if you buy the economy-size pain,
                but you can't evade the fundamental conservation law.
                If starting a startup were easy, everyone would do it.<br><br><b>Millions, not Billions</b><br><br>If $3
                million a year seems high to some people, it will seem
                low to others. Three <i>million?</i>
                How do I get to be a billionaire, like Bill Gates?<br><br>So let's get Bill Gates out of the way right
                now. It's not
                a good idea to use famous rich people
                as examples, because the press only
                write about the very richest, and these tend to be outliers.
                Bill Gates is a smart, determined, and hardworking man,
                but you need more than
                that to make as much money as he has. You also need to be
                very lucky.<br><br>There is a large random
                factor in the success of any company. So the guys you end
                up reading about in the papers are the ones who are very
                smart, totally dedicated, <i>and</i> win the lottery.
                Certainly Bill is smart and dedicated, but Microsoft also
                happens to have been the beneficiary of one of the most spectacular
                blunders in the history of business: the licensing deal for
                DOS. No doubt Bill did
                everything he could to steer IBM into making that blunder,
                and he has done an excellent job of exploiting it, but if
                there had been one person with a brain on IBM's side,
                Microsoft's future would have been very different.
                Microsoft at that stage had little leverage over IBM.
                They were effectively a component supplier. If IBM had
                required an exclusive license, as they should have, Microsoft
                would still have signed the deal. It would still have
                meant a lot of money for them, and IBM
                could easily have gotten an operating system elsewhere.<br><br>Instead IBM ended up using all its power
                in the market
                to give Microsoft control of the PC standard. From
                that point, all Microsoft had to do was execute. They
                never had to bet the company on a bold decision. All they
                had to do was play hardball with licensees and copy more
                innovative products reasonably promptly.<br><br>If IBM hadn't made this mistake, Microsoft would
                still have been a successful company, but it
                could not have grown so big so fast.
                Bill Gates would be rich, but he'd be somewhere
                near the bottom of the Forbes 400 with the other guys his age.<br><br>There are a lot of ways to get
                rich, and this essay is about only one of them. This
                essay is about how to make money by creating wealth and
                getting paid for it. There are plenty of other ways to
                get money, including chance, speculation, marriage, inheritance,
                theft, extortion, fraud, monopoly,
                graft, lobbying,
                counterfeiting, and prospecting. Most of the greatest fortunes
                have probably involved several of these.<br><br>The advantage of creating wealth, as a way to get rich,
                is not just that it's more legitimate
                (many of the other methods are now illegal)
                but that it's more
                <i>straightforward.</i> You just have to do something people want.<br><br><b>Money Is Not
                  Wealth</b><br><br>If you want to create wealth, it will help to understand what it is.
                Wealth is not the same thing as money.

                Wealth is as old as
                human history. Far older, in fact; ants have wealth.
                Money is a comparatively recent invention.<br><br>Wealth is the fundamental thing. Wealth is stuff we
                want: food,
                clothes, houses, cars, gadgets, travel to interesting places,
                and so on. You can have wealth without
                having money. If you had a magic machine that
                could on command make you a car or cook you dinner or do your
                laundry, or do anything else you wanted, you wouldn't need money.
                Whereas if you were in the middle of Antarctica, where there is
                nothing to buy, it wouldn't matter how much money you had.<br><br>Wealth is what you want, not money.
                But if wealth is the important
                thing, why does everyone talk about making money? It is
                a kind of shorthand: money is a way of moving wealth, and in practice
                they are usually interchangeable. But they are not the same thing,
                and unless you plan to get rich by counterfeiting, talking about
                <i>making money</i> can make it harder to understand how to
                make money.<br><br>Money is a side effect of specialization.
                In a specialized society, most of the
                things you need, you can't make for yourself. If you want a potato
                or a pencil or a place to live, you have to get it from someone
                else.<br><br>How do you get the person who grows the potatoes to give you some?
                By giving him something he wants in return. But you can't get
                very far by trading things directly with the people who
                need them. If you make violins, and none of the local
                farmers wants one, how will you eat?<br><br>The solution societies find, as they get more specialized,
                is to
                make the trade into a two-step process. Instead of trading violins
                directly for potatoes, you trade violins for, say, silver,
                which you can then trade again for anything else you need. The
                intermediate stuff — the <i>medium of exchange</i>-- can be anything that's
                rare and portable. Historically metals have been the most common,
                but recently we've been using a medium of exchange, called the <i>dollar</i>,
                that doesn't physically exist. It works as a medium of exchange,
                however, because its rarity
                is guaranteed by the U.S. Government.<br><br>The advantage of a medium of exchange is that it makes
                trade work.
                The disadvantage is that it tends to obscure what trade really
                means. People think that what a business does is make money.
                But money is just the intermediate stage — just
                a shorthand — for whatever people want.
                What most businesses really do is make
                wealth. They do something people want.

                the idea
                that there is a fixed amount of wealth in the world.
                There is, in any normal family, a fixed amount of <i>money</i> at
                any moment. But that's not the same thing.<br><br>When wealth is talked about in this context, it is
                often
                described as a pie. "You can't make the pie larger,"
                say politicians.
                When you're
                talking about the amount of money in one family's bank
                account, or the amount available to a government from one
                year's tax revenue, this is true.
                If one person gets more, someone else has to get less.<br><br>I can remember believing, as a child, that
                if a few
                rich people had all the money, it left less for everyone else.
                Many people seem to continue to believe something like this
                well into adulthood. This fallacy is usually there in the
                background when you hear someone talking about how x percent
                of the population have y percent of the wealth. If you plan
                to start a startup, then whether you realize it or not, you're
                planning to disprove the Pie Fallacy.<br><br>What leads people astray here is the abstraction of
                money. Money is not wealth. It's
                just something we use to move wealth around.
                So although there may be, in certain specific moments (like
                your family, this month) a fixed amount of money available to
                trade with other people for things you want,
                there is not a fixed amount of wealth in the world.
                <i>You can make more wealth.</i> Wealth has been getting created and
                destroyed (but on balance, created) for all of human history.<br><br>Suppose you own a beat-up old car.
                Instead of sitting on your butt next
                summer, you could spend the time restoring your car to pristine condition.
                In doing so you create wealth. The world is — and
                you specifically are — one pristine old car the richer. And not
                just in some metaphorical way. If you sell your car,
                you'll get more for it.<br><br>In restoring your old car you have made yourself
                richer. You haven't made anyone else poorer. So there is
                obviously not a fixed pie. And in fact, when you look at
                it this way, you wonder why anyone would think there was.

                wealth. If you need to give someone a present and don't
                have any money, you make one. But kids are so bad at making
                things that they consider home-made presents to be a distinct,
                inferior, sort of thing to store-bought ones — a mere expression
                of the proverbial thought that counts.
                And indeed, the lumpy ashtrays
                we made for our parents did not have much of a resale market.<br><br><b>Craftsmen</b><br><br>The people
                most likely to grasp that wealth can be
                created are the ones who are good at making things, the craftsmen.
                Their hand-made objects become store-bought ones.
                But with the rise of industrialization there are fewer and
                fewer craftsmen. One of the biggest remaining groups is
                computer programmers.<br><br>A programmer can sit down in front of a computer and
                <i>create wealth</i>. A good piece of software is, in itself,
                a valuable thing.
                There is no manufacturing to confuse the issue. Those
                characters you type
                are a complete, finished product.
                If someone sat down and wrote a web
                browser that didn't suck (a fine idea, by the way), the world
                would be that much richer.

                  </a>]</font><br><br>Everyone in a company works together to create
                wealth, in the sense of making more things people want.
                Many of the employees (e.g. the people in the mailroom or
                the personnel department) work at one remove from the
                actual making of stuff. Not the programmers. They
                literally think the product, one line at a time.
                And so it's clearer to programmers that wealth is something
                that's made, rather than being distributed, like slices of a
                pie, by some imaginary Daddy.<br><br>It's also obvious to programmers that there are huge variations
                in the rate at which wealth is created. At Viaweb we had one
                programmer who was a sort of monster of productivity.
                I remember watching what he did one long day and estimating that
                he had added several hundred thousand dollars
                to the market value of the company.
                A great programmer, on a roll, could
                create a million dollars worth of wealth in a couple weeks.
                A mediocre programmer over the same period will generate zero or
                even negative wealth (e.g. by introducing bugs).<br><br>This is
                why so many of the best programmers are libertarians.
                In our world, you sink or swim, and there are no excuses.
                When those far removed from the creation of wealth — undergraduates,
                reporters, politicians — hear
                that the richest 5% of the people have
                half the total wealth, they tend to think <i>injustice!</i>
                An experienced programmer would be more likely to think
                <i>is that all?</i> The top 5% of programmers
                probably write 99% of the good software.<br><br>Wealth can be created without being sold. Scientists,
                till
                recently at least, effectively donated the wealth they
                created. We are all richer for knowing about penicillin,
                because we're less likely to die from infections. Wealth
                is whatever people want, and not dying is certainly something
                we want. Hackers often donate their work by
                writing open source software that anyone can use for free.
                I am much the richer for the operating system
                FreeBSD, which I'm running on the computer I'm using now,
                and so is Yahoo, which runs it on all their servers.<br><br><b>What a Job Is</b><br><br>In
                industrialized countries, people belong to one institution or
                another at least until their twenties. After all those years you get
                used to the idea of belonging to a group of people who all get up
                in the morning, go to some set of buildings, and do things that they
                do not, ordinarily, enjoy doing. Belonging to such a group becomes
                part of your identity: name, age, role, institution.
                If you have to introduce yourself, or
                someone else describes you, it will be as something like, John
                Smith, age 10, a student at such and such elementary school, or
                John Smith, age 20, a student at such and such college.<br><br>When John Smith finishes school he is
                expected to get a job. And
                what getting a job seems to mean is joining another institution.
                Superficially it's a lot like college. You pick the companies you
                want to work for and apply to join them. If one likes you, you
                become a member of this new group. You get up in the morning and
                go to a new set of buildings, and do things that you do not, ordinarily,
                enjoy doing. There are a few differences: life is not as much fun,
                and you get paid, instead of paying, as you did in college. But
                the similarities feel greater than the differences. John Smith is
                now John Smith, 22, a software developer at such and such corporation.<br><br>In fact John Smith's
                life has changed more than he realizes. Socially, a company
                looks much like college, but the deeper you go into the
                underlying reality, the more different it gets.<br><br>What a company does, and has to do if it wants to
                continue to
                exist, is earn money. And the way most companies make money
                is by creating wealth. Companies can be so specialized that this
                similarity is concealed, but it is not only manufacturing
                companies that create wealth. A big component of wealth is
                location.
                Remember that magic machine that could
                make you cars and cook you dinner and so on? It would not be
                so useful if it delivered your dinner to a random location
                in central Asia.
                If wealth means what people want, companies that move
                things also create wealth. Ditto for
                many other kinds of companies that don't make anything
                physical. Nearly all companies exist to do something people
                want.<br><br>And that's what you do, as well, when you go to work for a company.
                But here there is another layer that tends to obscure the underlying
                reality. In a company, the work you do is averaged together with
                a lot of other people's.
                You may not even be aware you're doing something people
                want. Your contribution may be indirect. But the company as a
                whole must be giving people something they want, or they won't make
                any money. And if they are paying you x dollars a year, then on
                average you must be contributing at least x dollars a year worth
                of work, or the company will be spending more than it makes,
                and will go out of business.<br><br>Someone graduating from college thinks, and is told, that he needs
                to get a job, as if the important thing were becoming a member of
                an institution. A more direct way to put it would be: you need to
                start doing something people want. You don't
                need to
                join a company to do that. All a company is is a group of people
                working together to do something people want. It's doing something people
                want that matters, not joining the group.

                best plan probably is to go to work for some existing
                company. But it is a good idea to understand what's happening
                when you do this. A job means doing something people want,
                averaged together with everyone else in that company.<br><br><b>Working Harder</b><br><br>That averaging
                gets to be a problem.
                I think the single biggest problem afflicting large companies is the
                difficulty of assigning a value to each person's work.
                For the most part they punt. In a
                big company you get paid a fairly predictable salary for working
                fairly hard. You're expected not to be obviously incompetent or
                lazy, but you're not expected to devote your whole life to your
                work.<br><br>It turns out, though, that there are economies of scale in how much of your
                life you devote to your work. In the right kind of business,
                someone who really devoted himself to work could generate ten or
                even a hundred times as much wealth as an average
                employee. A programmer, for example, instead of chugging along
                maintaining and updating an existing piece of software, could write
                a whole new piece of software, and with it create a new source of
                revenue.<br><br>Companies are not set up to reward people who want to do this.
                You can't go to your boss and say, I'd like to start working ten
                times as hard, so will you please pay me ten times as much? For
                one thing, the official fiction is that you are already working as
                hard as you can. But a more serious problem is that the company
                has no way of measuring the value of your work.<br><br>Salesmen are an exception. It's easy
                to measure how much revenue they generate, and they're
                usually paid a percentage of it. If a salesman wants to work harder,
                he can just start doing it, and he will automatically
                get paid proportionally more.<br><br>There is one other job besides sales where big companies can
                hire first-rate people: in the top management jobs.
                And for the same reason: their performance can
                be measured. The top managers are
                held responsible for the performance of the entire company.
                Because an ordinary employee's performance can't usually
                be measured, he is not expected to do
                more than put in a solid effort. Whereas top management, like
                salespeople, have to actually come up with the numbers.
                The CEO of a company that tanks cannot plead that he put in
                a solid effort. If the company does badly, he's done badly.<br><br>A company that could pay all its
                employees so straightforwardly
                would be enormously successful. Many employees would work harder
                if they could get paid for it. More importantly,
                such a company would attract people who wanted to work
                especially hard.
                It would crush its competitors.<br><br>Unfortunately, companies can't pay everyone like salesmen.
                Salesmen
                work alone. Most employees' work is tangled together. Suppose
                a company makes some kind of consumer gadget. The
                engineers build a reliable gadget with all kinds of new features;
                the industrial designers design a beautiful case for it; and then
                the marketing people convince everyone that
                it's something they've got to have. How do you know how much of the
                gadget's sales are due to each group's efforts? Or, for that
                matter, how much is due to the creators of past gadgets that gave
                the company a reputation for quality? There's no way to
                untangle all their contributions. Even if you could read the minds
                of the consumers, you'd find these factors were all blurred together.<br><br>If you want to go faster,
                it's a problem to have your work
                tangled together with a large number of other people's. In a
                large group, your performance is not separately measurable — and
                the rest of the group slows you down.<br><br><b>Measurement and Leverage</b><br><br>To get rich you need
                to get yourself in a situation with two
                things, measurement and leverage. You need to be in a
                position where your performance can be measured, or there is
                no way to get paid more by doing more. And you have to
                have leverage, in the sense that the decisions you make have
                a big effect.<br><br>Measurement alone is not enough. An example of a job with
                measurement but not leverage is doing piecework in a
                sweatshop. Your performance is measured and you get paid
                accordingly, but you have no scope for decisions. The only
                decision you get to make is how fast you work, and that
                can probably only increase your earnings by a factor
                of two or three.<br><br>An example of a job with both measurement and leverage would
                be lead actor in a movie. Your performance can be measured in the
                gross of the movie. And you have leverage in the sense that your
                performance can make or break it.<br><br>CEOs also have both measurement and leverage. They're measured,
                in that the performance of the company is their performance.
                And they have leverage in that their decisions
                set the whole company moving in one direction or another.<br><br>I think everyone who gets rich by their
                own efforts will be
                found to be in a situation with measurement and leverage.
                Everyone I can think of does: CEOs, movie stars,
                hedge fund managers, professional athletes. A good hint to the
                presence of leverage is the possibility of failure.
                Upside must be balanced by downside, so if there is
                big potential for gain there must also be a terrifying
                possibility of loss. CEOs, stars, fund managers, and athletes
                all live with the sword hanging over their heads;
                the moment they start to suck, they're out. If you're in
                a job that feels safe, you are not going to get rich,
                because if there is no danger there is almost certainly no leverage.<br><br>But you don't have to become
                a CEO or a movie star to
                be in a situation with measurement and leverage. All you
                need to do is be part of a small group working on a
                hard problem.<br><br><b>Smallness = Measurement</b><br><br>If you can't measure the value of the work
                done by individual
                employees, you can get close. You can measure the value
                of the work done by small groups.<br><br>One level at which you can accurately measure the revenue
                generated by employees is at the level of the whole company.
                When the company is small, you are thereby fairly close to
                measuring the contributions of individual employees. A viable
                startup might only have ten employees, which puts you within a
                factor of ten of measuring individual effort.<br><br>Starting or joining a startup is thus as close as
                most
                people can get to saying to one's boss, I want to work ten times
                as hard, so please pay me ten times as much. There are two
                differences: you're not saying it to your boss, but directly to the
                customers (for whom your boss is only a proxy after all), and
                you're not doing it individually, but along with a small group
                of other ambitious people.<br><br>It will, ordinarily, be a group. Except in a few unusual kinds
                of work, like acting or writing books, you can't be a company
                of one person.
                And the people you work with had better be good, because it's their work that
                yours is going to be averaged with.<br><br>A big company is like a giant galley driven by a thousand
                rowers.
                Two things keep the speed of the
                galley down. One is that individual rowers don't see any
                result from working harder.
                The other is that, in a group of a
                thousand people, the average rower is likely to be
                pretty average.<br><br>If you took ten people at random out of the big galley and
                put them in a boat by themselves, they could probably go
                faster. They would have both carrot and stick to motivate
                them. An energetic rower would be encouraged by the thought
                that he could have a visible effect on the speed of
                the boat. And if someone was lazy, the others would be more likely
                to notice and complain.<br><br>But the real advantage of the ten-man boat shows when
                you take the ten <i>best</i> rowers out of the big galley
                and put them in a boat together. They will have all
                the extra motivation that comes from being in a small group.
                But more importantly, by selecting that small a group
                you can get the best rowers. Each one will be in
                the top 1%. It's a much better deal for them to average
                their work together with a small group of their peers than to
                average it with everyone.<br><br>That's the real point of startups. Ideally, you are getting
                together with a group of other people who also want to work
                a lot harder, and get paid a lot more, than they would in
                a big company. And because startups tend to get founded
                by self-selecting groups of ambitious people who already
                know one another (at least by reputation), the level of
                measurement is more precise than you get from smallness alone.
                A startup is not merely ten people, but ten people like you.<br><br>Steve Jobs once said that the
                success or failure of a startup
                depends on the first ten employees. I agree. If
                anything, it's more like the first five.
                Being small is not, in itself, what makes startups kick butt,
                but rather that small groups can be select.
                You don't want small in the sense of a
                village, but small in the sense of an all-star team.<br><br>The larger a group, the closer its average
                member will be to the average
                for the population as a whole. So all other things being
                equal, a very able person in a big company is probably
                getting a bad deal, because his performance is dragged down by
                the overall lower performance of the others. Of course,
                all other things often are not equal: the able person may
                not care about money, or may prefer the stability of a large
                company. But a very able person who does care about money
                will ordinarily do better to go off and work with a small
                group of peers.<br><br><b>Technology = Leverage</b><br><br>Startups offer anyone a way to be in a
                situation with
                measurement and leverage.
                They allow measurement because they're small,
                and they offer leverage because they
                make money by inventing new technology.<br><br>What is technology? It's <i>technique</i>. It's the way
                we all do things. And when
                you discover a new way to do things, its value is multiplied
                by all the people who use it. It is the proverbial fishing
                rod, rather than the fish. That's the difference between a
                startup and a restaurant or a barber shop. You fry eggs or cut
                hair one customer at a time. Whereas if
                you solve a technical problem that a lot of people care about,
                you help everyone who uses your solution.
                That's leverage.<br><br>If you look at history, it seems that most people
                who got rich by creating wealth did it by developing
                new technology. You just can't fry eggs or cut hair fast enough.
                What made the Florentines rich in 1200
                was the discovery of new techniques for making the high-tech
                product of the time, fine woven cloth. What made the
                Dutch rich in 1600 was the discovery of shipbuilding and
                navigation techniques that enabled them to dominate the seas
                of the Far East.<br><br>Fortunately there is a natural fit between smallness and
                solving hard problems. The leading edge of technology moves
                fast. Technology that's valuable today could be worthless
                in a couple years. Small companies are more at home in this
                world, because they don't have layers of bureaucracy to
                slow them down.
                Also, technical advances tend to come from unorthodox approaches,
                and small companies are less constrained by convention.<br><br>Big companies can develop technology.
                They just can't do it
                quickly. Their size makes them slow and prevents
                them from rewarding employees for the extraordinary
                effort required. So in practice big companies only get to develop
                technology in fields where large capital requirements prevent startups from
                competing with them, like microprocessors, power plants,
                or passenger aircraft. And even in those fields they depend heavily
                on startups for components and ideas.<br><br>It's obvious that biotech or software startups exist to
                solve
                hard technical problems, but
                I think it will also be found to be true
                in businesses that don't seem to be about technology. McDonald's,
                for example, grew big by designing a system, the McDonald's
                franchise, that could then be reproduced at will all over the
                face of the earth. A McDonald's franchise is controlled by rules
                so precise that it is practically
                a piece of software. Write once, run everywhere.
                Ditto for Wal-Mart. Sam Walton got rich not by being a
                retailer, but by designing a new kind of store.<br><br>Use difficulty as a guide not just in selecting
                the overall
                aim of your company, but also at decision points along the way.
                At Viaweb one of our rules of thumb was <i>run upstairs.</i>
                Suppose you are a little, nimble guy being chased by a big,
                fat, bully. You open a door and find yourself in a
                staircase. Do you go up or down? I say up. The
                bully can probably run downstairs as fast as you can.
                Going upstairs his bulk will be more of a disadvantage.
                Running upstairs is hard for you but even harder for him.<br><br>What this meant in practice was that we
                deliberately sought
                hard problems. If there were two features we could add to our
                software, both equally valuable in proportion to their difficulty,
                we'd always take the harder one. Not just because it was
                more valuable, but <i>because it was harder.</i>
                We delighted in forcing bigger, slower competitors
                to follow us over difficult ground.
                Like guerillas, startups prefer the difficult terrain of the
                mountains, where the troops of the central government
                can't follow. I can remember times when we were just
                exhausted after wrestling all day with some horrible technical
                problem. And I'd be delighted, because something that was
                hard for us would be impossible for our competitors.<br><br>This is not just a good way to run a
                startup. It's what
                a startup is.
                Venture capitalists know about this and have a phrase for it:
                <i>barriers to entry.</i> If you go to a VC with a new
                idea and ask him to invest in it, one of the first things
                he'll ask is, how hard would this be for someone else to
                develop? That is, how much difficult ground
                have you put between yourself and potential pursuers?

                  </a>]</font>
                And you had better have a convincing explanation of why
                your technology would be hard to duplicate. Otherwise as
                soon as some big company becomes aware of it, they'll make
                their own, and with their brand name, capital, and
                distribution clout, they'll take away your market overnight.
                You'd be like guerillas caught in the open field by regular
                army forces.<br><br>One way to put up barriers to entry is through patents.
                But patents may not provide much protection.
                Competitors commonly find ways to work around a patent.
                And if they can't, they
                may simply violate it and invite you to sue them.
                A big company is not afraid to be sued; it's an everyday thing
                for them. They'll make sure that suing them is expensive and
                takes a long time.
                Ever heard of Philo Farnsworth? He invented
                television. The reason you've never
                heard of him is that his company was not the one to make
                money from it.

                The company that did was RCA, and
                Farnsworth's reward for his efforts was a decade of
                patent litigation.<br><br>Here, as so often, the best defense is a good offense. If
                you can develop technology that's simply too hard for
                competitors to duplicate, you don't need to rely on other
                defenses. Start by picking a hard problem, and
                then at every decision point, take the harder choice.

                an ordinary employee and getting paid proportionately, it would
                obviously be a good deal to start a startup. Up to a point it
                would be more fun. I don't think many people
                like the slow pace of big companies, the interminable meetings,
                the water-cooler conversations, the clueless middle managers,
                and so on.<br><br>Unfortunately there are a couple catches. One is that you
                can't choose the point on the curve that you want to inhabit.
                You can't decide, for example, that you'd like to work just
                two or three times as hard, and get paid that much more. When
                you're running a startup, your competitors decide how
                hard you work. And they pretty much all make the same decision:
                as hard as you possibly can.<br><br>The other catch is that the payoff is only on average proportionate
                to your productivity. There is, as I said before, a large
                random multiplier in the success of any company. So in
                practice the deal is not that you're 30 times as productive and get
                paid 30 times as much. It is that you're 30 times as productive,
                and get paid between zero and a thousand times as much.
                If the mean is 30x, the median is probably zero.
                Most startups tank, and not just the dogfood
                portals we all heard about during
                the Internet Bubble. It's common for a startup
                to be developing a genuinely good product, take slightly
                too long to do it, run out of money, and have to shut down.<br><br>A startup is like a mosquito. A bear
                can absorb a hit and a crab
                is armored against one, but a mosquito is designed for one thing:
                to score. No energy is wasted on defense. The defense of mosquitos,
                as a species, is that there are a lot of them, but this is little
                consolation to the individual mosquito.<br><br>Startups, like mosquitos, tend to be an all-or-nothing
                proposition.
                And you don't generally know which of the two you're going to
                get till the last minute.
                Viaweb came close to tanking several times. Our trajectory
                was like a sine wave. Fortunately we got bought at
                the top of the cycle, but it was damned close. While we were
                visiting Yahoo in California to talk about selling the company
                to them, we had to borrow a conference room to reassure
                an investor who was about to back out of a new round of funding
                that we needed to stay alive.<br><br>The all-or-nothing aspect of startups was not something we wanted.
                Viaweb's hackers were all extremely risk-averse.
                If there had been some way just to work super hard and get
                paid for it, without having a lottery mixed in, we would have
                been delighted. We would have much preferred a 100% chance of
                $1 million to a 20% chance of $10 million, even though
                theoretically the second is worth twice as much. Unfortunately,
                there is not currently any space in the business world where
                you can get the first deal.<br><br>The closest you can get is by
                selling your startup in the early stages, giving up upside
                (and risk) for a smaller but guaranteed payoff. We had a
                chance to do this, and stupidly, as we then thought, let it slip by.
                After that we became comically eager to sell.
                For the next year or so,
                if anyone expressed the slightest curiosity about Viaweb
                we would try to sell them the company. But there were no takers,
                so we had to keep going.<br><br>It would have been a bargain to
                buy us at an early stage, but companies doing acquisitions are not
                looking for bargains. A company big enough to acquire
                startups will be big enough to be fairly conservative, and
                within the company the people in charge of acquisitions will
                be among the more conservative, because they are likely to be
                business school types who joined the company late.
                They would rather overpay for a safe choice. So
                it is easier to sell an established startup, even at a large
                premium, than an early-stage one.<br><br><b>Get Users</b><br><br>I think it's a good idea to get bought,
                if you can. Running a
                business is different from growing one.
                It is just as well to let a big company take over once you reach
                cruising altitude. It's
                also financially wiser, because selling allows you to diversify.
                What would you think of a financial advisor who put all his
                client's assets into one volatile stock?<br><br>How do you get bought? Mostly by doing the same things
                you'd do if you didn't intend to sell the company. Being
                profitable, for example. But getting bought is also an art
                in its own right, and one that we spent a lot of time trying
                to master.<br><br>Potential buyers will
                always delay if they can. The hard part about getting
                bought is getting them to act. For most people, the most powerful motivator
                is not the hope of gain, but the fear of loss. For potential
                acquirers, the most powerful motivator is the prospect that
                one of their competitors will buy you. This, as we found,
                causes CEOs to take red-eyes.
                The second biggest is the worry that, if they don't buy you
                now, you'll continue to grow rapidly and will cost more to
                acquire later, or even become a competitor.<br><br>In both cases, what it all comes down to is users.
                You'd think that a company about to buy you would do a lot of
                research and decide for themselves how valuable your technology
                was. Not at all. What they go by is the number of users you
                have.<br><br>In effect, acquirers assume the customers know who has the
                best technology. And this is not as stupid as it sounds. Users
                are the only real proof that you've created wealth. Wealth is
                what people want, and if people aren't using your software,
                maybe it's not just because you're bad at marketing. Maybe it's
                because you haven't made what they want.<br><br>Venture capitalists have a list of danger signs to watch
                out for.
                Near the top is the company run by techno-weenies who are
                obsessed with solving interesting technical problems, instead
                of making users happy. In a startup, you're not just trying to
                solve problems. You're trying to solve problems <i>that
                  users care about.</i><br><br>So I think you should make users the test, just as
                acquirers do. Treat a startup as an optimization problem
                in which performance is measured by number of users. As anyone
                who has tried to optimize software knows, the key is measurement.
                When you try to guess where your program is slow, and what would
                make it faster, you almost always guess wrong.<br><br>Number of users may not be the perfect test, but
                it will
                be very close. It's what acquirers care about. It's what
                revenues depend on.
                It's what makes competitors unhappy.
                It's what impresses reporters, and potential
                new users. Certainly it's a better test than your a priori
                notions of what problems are important to solve, no matter how
                technically adept you are.<br><br>Among other things, treating a startup as an optimization
                problem will help you avoid another
                pitfall that VCs worry about, and rightly — taking a long time
                to develop a product. Now we can recognize this as something
                hackers already know to avoid: premature optimization. Get a version
                1.0 out there as soon as you can. Until you have some users to
                measure, you're optimizing based on guesses.<br><br>The ball you need to keep your eye on here is the
                underlying
                principle that wealth is what people want. If you plan to get
                rich by creating wealth, you have to know what people want.
                So few businesses really pay attention to making customers happy.
                How often do you walk into a store, or call a company on the
                phone, with a feeling of dread in the back of your mind?
                When you hear "your call is important to us, please stay on
                the line," do you think, oh good, now everything will be all right?<br><br>A restaurant can afford to
                serve the occasional burnt dinner.
                But in technology, you cook one thing and that's what everyone
                eats. So any difference between what people want and what
                you deliver is multiplied.
                You please or annoy
                customers wholesale. The closer you can get to what they want,
                the more wealth you generate.<br><br><b>Wealth and Power</b><br><br>Making wealth is not the only way to
                get rich. For most of
                human history it has not even been the most common. Until
                a few centuries ago,
                the main sources of wealth were mines, slaves and serfs,
                land, and cattle,
                and the only ways to acquire these rapidly were by inheritance,
                marriage, conquest, or confiscation.
                Naturally wealth had a bad reputation.<br><br>Two things changed. The first was the rule of law. For
                most of the world's
                history, if you did somehow accumulate a fortune, the ruler or his
                henchmen
                would find a way to steal it.
                But in medieval Europe something new happened.
                A new class of merchants and manufacturers
                began to collect in towns.

                Together they were able to withstand the local feudal
                lord. So
                for the first time in our history, the bullies stopped stealing the
                nerds' lunch money.
                This was naturally a great incentive,
                and possibly indeed the main cause of the second big change,
                industrialization.<br><br>A great deal has been written about the causes of the Industrial
                Revolution. But surely a necessary, if not sufficient, condition
                was that people who made fortunes be able to enjoy them in peace.

                One piece of evidence is what happened to countries
                that tried to return to the old model, like the Soviet
                Union, and to a lesser extent Britain under the labor
                governments of the 1960s and early 1970s. Take away the incentive
                of wealth, and technical innovation grinds to a halt.<br><br>Remember what a startup is, economically:
                a way of saying, I want to work faster. Instead of accumulating
                money slowly by being paid a regular wage for fifty years, I
                want to get it over with as soon as possible. So governments
                that forbid you to accumulate wealth are in effect decreeing
                that you work slowly. They're willing to let you earn $3 million over
                fifty years, but they're not willing to let you work so hard that
                you can do it in two. They are like
                the corporate boss that you can't go to and say, I want to work
                ten times as hard, so please pay me ten times a much.
                Except this is not a boss you can escape by starting your own
                company.<br><br>The problem with working slowly is not just that technical
                innovation happens slowly. It's that it tends not to happen at all.
                It's only when you're deliberately looking for hard problems,
                as a way to use speed to the greatest advantage, that you take
                on this kind of project. Developing new technology is a
                pain in the ass. It is, as Edison said, one percent
                inspiration and ninety-nine percent perspiration.
                Without the incentive of wealth, no one wants to do it.
                Engineers will work on sexy projects like fighter planes and moon
                rockets for ordinary salaries, but more mundane technologies
                like light bulbs or semiconductors have to be developed by entrepreneurs.<br><br>Startups
                are not just something that happened in Silicon Valley in
                the last couple decades. Since it became possible to
                get rich by creating wealth, everyone who has done it has
                used essentially the same recipe: measurement and leverage,
                where measurement comes from working with a small
                group, and leverage from developing new techniques.
                The recipe was the same in Florence in 1200 as it is
                in Santa Clara today.<br><br>Understanding this may help to answer an important question:
                why Europe grew so powerful.
                Was it something about the geography of
                Europe? Was it that Europeans are somehow racially superior?
                Was it their religion? The answer (or at least
                the proximate cause) may be that the
                Europeans
                rode on the crest of a powerful new idea: allowing those who
                made a lot of money to keep it.<br><br>Once you're allowed to do that,
                people who want to get rich can do it by generating

                The resulting technological growth translates not only
                into wealth but into military power. The theory that led to
                the stealth plane was developed by a Soviet mathematician.
                But because the Soviet Union didn't have a computer industry,
                it remained for them a theory;
                they didn't have hardware capable of executing the calculations
                fast enough to design an actual airplane.<br><br>In that respect the Cold War teaches the same lesson as

                One valuable thing you tend to get only in startups is
                <i>uninterruptability</i>. Different kinds of
                work have different time quanta. Someone proofreading a
                manuscript
                could probably be interrupted every fifteen minutes
                with little loss of productivity. But the time quantum for
                hacking is very long: it might take an hour just to load
                a problem into your head. So the
                cost of having someone from personnel
                call you about a form you forgot to fill out can be huge.<br><br>This is why hackers give you such a
                baleful stare as they
                turn from their screen to answer your question. Inside
                their heads a giant house of cards is tottering.<br><br>The mere possibility of being interrupted deters
                hackers
                from starting hard projects. This is why they
                tend to work late at night, and why it's next to impossible
                to write great software in a cubicle (except late at night).<br><br>One great advantage of startups is
                that they don't yet have
                any of the people who interrupt you. There is no personnel
                department, and thus no form nor anyone to call you about it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n">

                Faced with the idea that people working for startups might be
                20 or 30 times as productive as those working for large companies,
                executives at large companies will naturally wonder, how could
                I get the people working for me to do that? The answer is
                simple: pay them to.<br><br>Internally most companies are run like Communist states.

                Until recently even governments sometimes didn't grasp the
                distinction between money and wealth. Adam
                Smith (<i>Wealth of Nations</i>, v:i) mentions several
                that tried to preserve their
                "wealth" by forbidding the export of gold or silver.
                But having more of the medium of exchange would not make
                a country richer; if you have more money chasing the same
                amount of material wealth, the only result is higher prices.<br><br>[<a name="f4n">

                There are many senses of the word "wealth," not all of
                them material. I'm not trying to make a deep philosophical
                point here about which
                is the true kind. I'm writing about one specific,
                rather technical sense of the word "wealth." What
                people will give you money for.
                This is an interesting sort of wealth to study, because
                it is the kind that prevents you from starving.
                And what people will give you money for depends on them,
                not you.<br><br>When you're starting a business,
                it's easy to slide into thinking that customers
                want what you do. During the Internet Bubble I talked
                to a woman who, because she liked the outdoors, was
                starting an "outdoor portal." You know what
                kind of business you should start if you like
                the outdoors? One to recover data from crashed hard disks.<br><br>What's the connection? None at all.
                Which is precisely my point.
                If you want
                to create wealth (in the narrow technical sense of not
                starving) then you should be especially skeptical about any
                plan that centers on things you like doing.
                That is where your idea of what's valuable is least
                likely to coincide with other people's.<br><br>[<a name="f5n">

                In the average car restoration you probably do make everyone
                else microscopically poorer, by doing a small amount of damage to
                the environment. While environmental costs should be taken
                into account, they don't
                make wealth a zero-sum game. For example, if you repair
                a machine that's broken because a part has come unscrewed,
                you create wealth with no environmental cost.<br><br>[<a name="f5bn">

                Many people feel confused and depressed in
                their early twenties. Life seemed so much more fun in college.
                Well, of course it was. Don't be fooled by the surface similarities.
                You've gone from guest to servant.
                It's possible to have fun in this new world.
                Among other things, you now get to go behind the doors that say
                "authorized personnel only."

                When VCs asked us how long it would take another startup
                to duplicate our software, we used to reply that they probably
                wouldn't be able to at all. I think this made us seem naive,

                Few technologies have one clear inventor. So as
                a rule, if you know the "inventor" of something
                (the telephone, the assembly line, the airplane,
                the light bulb, the transistor) it is because their
                company made money from it, and the company's PR people worked
                hard to spread the story. If you don't know who invented
                something (the automobile, the television, the computer,
                the jet engine, the laser), it's because other companies
                made all the money.<br><br>[<a name="f9n">

                This is a good plan for life in general.
                If you have two choices, choose the harder.
                If you're trying to decide whether to go out running or
                sit home and watch TV, go running.
                Probably the reason this trick works so well is that
                when you have two choices and one is harder, the
                only reason you're even considering the other is laziness.
                You know in the back of your mind what's the right thing
                to do, and this trick merely forces you to acknowledge it.<br><br>[<a name="f10n">

                It is probably no accident that the middle class
                first appeared in northern Italy and the low countries,
                where there were no strong central governments. These two
                regions were the richest of their time and became the twin
                centers from which Renaissance civilization radiated.
                If they no longer play that role, it is because
                other places, like the United States, have been truer to the
                principles they discovered.<br><br>[<a name="f11n">

                It may indeed be a sufficient condition. But if so, why didn't
                the Industrial Revolution happen earlier? Two possible (and
                not incompatible) answers: (a) It did.
                The Industrial Revolution was one in a series.
                (b) Because in medieval towns, monopolies
                and guild regulations initially slowed the development of new means
                of production.<br><br><a href="http://reddit.com"><img
