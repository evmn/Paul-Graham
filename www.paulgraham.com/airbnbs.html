        <article>December 2020<br><br>To celebrate Airbnb's IPO and to
                help future founders, I thought
                it might be useful to explain what was special about
                Airbnb.<br><br>What was special about the Airbnbs was
                how earnest they were. They
                did nothing half-way, and we could sense this even in
                the interview.
                Sometimes after we interviewed a startup we'd be
                uncertain what to
                do, and have to talk it over. Other times we'd just look
                at one
                another and smile. The Airbnbs' interview was that kind.
                We didn't
                even like the idea that much. Nor did users, at that
                stage; they
                had no growth. But the founders seemed so full of energy
                that it
                was impossible not to like them.<br><br>That first
                impression was not misleading. During the batch our
                nickname for Brian Chesky was The Tasmanian Devil,
                because like the
                <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=StG2u5qfFRg&t=2m27s">cartoon
                        character</a> he seemed a tornado of energy. All
                three of them were
                like that. No one ever worked harder during YC than the
                Airbnbs
                did. When you talked to the Airbnbs, they took notes. If
                you suggested
                an idea to them in office hours, the next time you
                talked to them
                they'd not only have implemented it, but also
                implemented two new
                ideas they had in the process. "They probably have the
                best attitude
                of any startup we've funded" I wrote to Mike Arrington
                during the
                batch.<br><br>They're still like that. Jessica and I had
                dinner with Brian in the
                summer of 2018, just the three of us. By this point the
                company is
                ten years old. He took a page of notes about ideas for
                new things
                Airbnb could do.<br><br>What we didn't realize when we
                first met Brian and Joe and Nate was
                that Airbnb was on its last legs. After working on the
                company for
                a year and getting no growth, they'd agreed to give it
                one last
                shot. They'd try this Y Combinator thing, and if the
                company still
                didn't take off, they'd give up.<br><br>Any normal
                person would have given up already. They'd been funding
                the company with credit cards. They had a <i>binder</i>
                full of
                credit cards they'd maxed out. Investors didn't think
                much of the
                idea. One investor they met in a cafe walked out in the
                middle of
                meeting with them. They thought he was going to the
                bathroom, but
                he never came back. "He didn't even finish his
                smoothie," Brian
                said. And now, in late 2008, it was the worst recession
                in decades.
                The stock market was in free fall and wouldn't hit
                bottom for another
                four months.<br><br>Why hadn't they given up? This is a
                useful question to ask. People,
                like matter, reveal their nature under extreme
                conditions. One thing
                that's clear is that they weren't doing this just for
                the money.
                As a money-making scheme, this was pretty lousy: a
                year's work and
                all they had to show for it was a binder full of
                maxed-out credit
                cards. So why were they still working on this startup?
                Because of
                the experience they'd had as the first
                hosts.<br><br>When they first tried renting out airbeds
                on their floor during a
                design convention, all they were hoping for was to make
                enough money
                to pay their rent that month. But something surprising
                happened:
                they enjoyed having those first three guests staying
                with them. And
                the guests enjoyed it too. Both they and the guests had
                done it
                because they were in a sense forced to, and yet they'd
                all had a
                great experience. Clearly there was something new here:
                for hosts,
                a new way to make money that had literally been right
                under their
                noses, and for guests, a new way to travel that was in
                many ways
                better than hotels.<br><br>That experience was why the
                Airbnbs didn't give up. They knew they'd
                discovered something. They'd seen a glimpse of the
                future, and they
                couldn't let it go.<br><br>They knew that once people
                tried staying in what is now called "an
                airbnb," they would also realize that this was the
                future. But only
                if they tried it, and they weren't. That was the problem
                during Y
                Combinator: to get growth started.<br><br>Airbnb's goal
                during YC was to reach what we call <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ramenprofitable.html">ramen
                        profitability</a>,
                which means making enough money that the company can pay
                the founders'
                living expenses, if they live on ramen noodles. Ramen
                profitability
                is not, obviously, the end goal of any startup, but it's
                the most
                important threshold on the way, because this is the
                point where
                you're airborne. This is the point where you no longer
                need investors'
                permission to continue existing. For the Airbnbs, ramen
                profitability
                was $4000 a month: $3500 for rent, and $500 for food.
                They taped
                this goal to the mirror in the bathroom of their
                apartment.<br><br>The way to get growth started in
                something like Airbnb is to focus
                on the hottest subset of the market. If you can get
                growth started
                there, it will spread to the rest. When I asked the
                Airbnbs where
                there was most demand, they knew from searches: New York
                City. So
                they focused on New York. They went there <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">in
                        person</a> to visit their
                hosts and help them make their listings more attractive.
                A big part
                of that was better pictures. So Joe and Brian rented a
                professional
                camera and took pictures of the hosts' places
                themselves.<br><br>This didn't just make the listings
                better. It also taught them about
                their hosts. When they came back from their first trip
                to New York,
                I asked what they'd noticed about hosts that surprised
                them, and
                they said the biggest surprise was how many of the hosts
                were in
                the same position they'd been in: they needed this money
                to pay
                their rent. This was, remember, the worst recession in
                decades, and
                it had hit New York first. It definitely added to the
                Airbnbs' sense
                of mission to feel that people needed them.<br><br>In
                late January 2009, about three weeks into Y Combinator,
                their
                efforts started to show results, and their numbers crept
                upward.
                But it was hard to say for sure whether it was growth or
                just random
                fluctuation. By February it was clear that it was real
                growth. They
                made $460 in fees in the first week of February, $897 in
                the second,
                and $1428 in the third. That was it: they were airborne.
                Brian sent
                me an email on February 22 announcing that they were
                ramen profitable
                and giving the last three weeks' numbers.<br><br>"I
                assume you know what you've now set yourself up for next
                week,"
                I responded.<br><br>Brian's reply was seven words: "We
                are not going to slow down."<br><br>
