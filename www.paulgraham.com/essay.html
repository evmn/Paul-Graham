        <article>September 2004<br><br>Remember the essays you had to
                write in high school?
                Topic sentence, introductory paragraph,
                supporting paragraphs, conclusion. The conclusion being,
                say, that Ahab in <i>Moby Dick</i> was a Christ-like
                figure.<br><br>Oy. So I'm going to try to give the other
                side of the
                story: what an essay really is, and how you write one.
                Or at least, how I write
                one.<br><br><b>Mods</b><br><br>The most obvious
                difference between real essays and
                the things one has to write in school is that real
                essays are not exclusively about English literature.
                Certainly schools should teach students how to
                write. But due to a series of historical accidents
                the teaching of
                writing has gotten mixed together with the study
                of literature. And so all over the country students are
                writing not about how a baseball team with a small
                budget
                might compete with the Yankees, or the role of color in
                fashion, or what constitutes a good dessert, but about
                symbolism in Dickens.<br><br>With the result that
                writing is made to seem boring and
                pointless. Who cares about symbolism in Dickens?
                Dickens himself would be more interested in an essay
                about color or baseball.<br><br>How did things get this
                way? To answer that we have to go back
                almost a thousand years. Around 1100, Europe at last
                began to
                catch its breath after centuries of chaos, and once they
                had the luxury of curiosity they rediscovered
                what we call "the classics." The effect was rather as if
                we were visited by beings from another solar system.
                These earlier civilizations were so much more
                sophisticated
                that for the next several centuries the main work of
                European scholars, in almost every field, was to
                assimilate
                what they knew.<br><br>During this period the study of
                ancient texts acquired great
                prestige. It seemed the essence of what scholars did. As
                European scholarship gained momentum it became less and
                less important;
                by 1350
                someone who wanted to learn about science could find
                better
                teachers than Aristotle in his own era. [1]
                But schools change slower than scholarship. In the
                19th century the study of ancient texts was still the
                backbone
                of the curriculum.<br><br>The time was then ripe for the
                question: if the study of
                ancient texts is a valid field for scholarship, why not
                modern
                texts? The answer, of course, is that the original
                raison d'etre
                of classical scholarship was a kind of intellectual
                archaeology that
                does not need to be done in the case of contemporary
                authors.
                But for obvious reasons no one wanted to give that
                answer.
                The archaeological work being mostly done, it implied
                that
                those studying the classics were, if not wasting their
                time, at least working on problems of minor
                importance.<br><br>And so began the study of modern
                literature. There was a good
                deal of resistance at first.
                The first courses in English literature
                seem to have been offered by the newer colleges,
                particularly
                American ones. Dartmouth, the University of Vermont,
                Amherst,
                and University College, London
                taught English literature in the 1820s.
                <!--The newly founded University
of London had the first professor of English language and literature
in 1828, and Lafayette College the second in 1857.-->
                But Harvard didn't have a professor of English
                literature until
                1876, and Oxford not till 1885. (Oxford had a chair of
                Chinese before
                it had one of English.) [2]<br><br>What tipped the
                scales, at least in the US, seems to have
                been the idea that professors should do research as well
                as teach. This idea (along with the PhD, the department,
                and
                indeed the whole concept of the modern university) was
                imported
                from Germany in the late 19th century. Beginning at
                Johns Hopkins in 1876, the new model spread
                rapidly.<br><br>Writing was one of the casualties.
                Colleges had long taught
                English composition. But how do you do research on
                composition?
                The professors who taught math could be required to do
                original
                math, the professors who taught history could be
                required to
                write scholarly articles about history, but what about
                the
                professors who taught rhetoric or composition? What
                should they
                do research on? The closest thing seemed to be English
                literature. [3]<br><br>And so in the late 19th century
                the teaching of writing was inherited
                by English professors. This had two drawbacks:
                (a) an expert on literature need not himself be a good
                writer,
                any more than an art historian has to be a good painter,
                and (b)
                the subject of writing now tends to be literature, since
                that's
                what the professor is interested in.<br><br>High schools
                imitate universities. The seeds of our miserable
                high school experiences were sown in 1892, when
                the National Education Association
                "formally recommended that literature
                and composition be unified in the high school course."
                [4]
                The 'riting component of the 3 Rs then morphed into
                English,
                with the bizarre consequence that high school students
                now
                had to write about English literature — to write,
                without
                even realizing it, imitations of whatever
                English professors had been publishing in their journals
                a
                few decades before.<br><br>It's no wonder if this seems
                to the
                student a pointless exercise, because we're now three
                steps
                removed from real work: the students are imitating
                English
                professors, who are imitating classical scholars, who
                are
                merely the inheritors of a tradition growing out of what
                was, 700 years ago, fascinating and urgently needed
                work.<br><br><b>No Defense</b><br><br>The other big
                difference between a real essay and the things
                they make you write in school is that a real essay
                doesn't
                take a position and then defend it. That principle,
                like the idea that we ought to be writing about
                literature,
                turns out to be another intellectual hangover of long
                forgotten origins.<br><br>It's often mistakenly believed
                that
                medieval universities were mostly seminaries. In fact
                they
                were more law schools. And at least in our tradition
                lawyers are advocates, trained to take
                either side of an argument and make as good a case for
                it
                as they can.
                Whether cause or effect, this spirit pervaded
                early universities. The study of rhetoric, the art of
                arguing
                persuasively, was a third of the undergraduate
                curriculum. [5]
                And after the lecture the most common form
                of discussion was the disputation. This is at least
                nominally preserved in our present-day thesis defense:
                most people treat the words thesis
                and dissertation as interchangeable, but originally, at
                least,
                a thesis was a position one took and the dissertation
                was
                the argument by which one defended it.<br><br>Defending
                a position may be a necessary evil in a
                legal dispute, but it's not the best way to get at the
                truth,
                as I think lawyers would be the first to admit. It's not
                just that you miss subtleties this way.
                The real problem is that you can't change the
                question.<br><br>And yet this principle is built into
                the very structure of
                the things they teach you to write in high school. The
                topic
                sentence is your thesis, chosen in advance, the
                supporting
                paragraphs the blows you strike in the conflict, and the
                conclusion — uh, what is the conclusion? I was never
                sure
                about that in high school. It seemed as if we were just
                supposed to restate what we said in the first paragraph,
                but in different enough words that no one could tell.
                Why bother?
                But when you understand the origins
                of this sort of "essay," you can see where the
                conclusion comes from. It's the concluding remarks to
                the
                jury.<br><br>Good writing should be convincing,
                certainly, but it
                should be convincing because you got the right answers,
                not because you did a good job of arguing. When I give a
                draft of an essay to friends, there are two things
                I want to know: which parts bore them, and which seem
                unconvincing. The boring bits can usually be fixed by
                cutting. But I don't try to fix the unconvincing bits by
                arguing more cleverly. I need to talk the matter
                over.<br><br>At the very least I must have explained
                something badly. In
                that case, in the course of the conversation I'll be
                forced
                to come up a with a clearer explanation, which I can
                just
                incorporate in the essay. More often than not I have
                to change what I was saying as well.
                But the aim is never to be convincing per se.
                As the reader gets smarter, convincing and true become
                identical,
                so if I can convince smart readers I must be near the
                truth.<br><br>The sort of writing that attempts to
                persuade may be
                a valid (or at least inevitable) form, but it's
                historically
                inaccurate to call it an essay. An essay is
                something else.<br><br><b>Trying</b><br><br>To
                understand what a real essay is, we have to
                reach back into history again, though this time not so
                far.
                To Michel de Montaigne, who in 1580 published a book of
                what he called "essais." He was
                doing something quite different from what lawyers do,
                and
                the difference is embodied in the name. <i>Essayer</i>
                is the French
                verb meaning "to try"
                and an <i>essai</i> is an attempt. An essay is something
                you
                write to try to figure something out.<br><br>Figure out
                what? You don't know yet. And so you can't begin with a
                thesis, because you don't have one, and may never have
                one. An essay doesn't begin with a statement, but with a
                question. In a real essay, you don't take a position and
                defend it. You notice a door that's ajar, and you open
                it and
                walk in to see what's inside.<br><br>If all you want to
                do is figure things out, why do you need
                to write anything, though? Why not just sit and think?
                Well,
                there precisely is Montaigne's great discovery.
                Expressing
                ideas helps to form them. Indeed, helps is far too weak
                a
                word. Most of what ends up in my essays I only
                thought of when I sat down to write them. That's why I
                write them.<br><br>In the things you write in school you
                are, in theory,
                merely explaining yourself to the reader.
                In a real essay you're writing for yourself.
                You're thinking out loud.<br><br>But not quite.
                Just as inviting people over forces you to
                clean up your apartment, writing something that
                other people will read forces you to think well. So it
                does matter to have an audience. The things I've written
                just for myself are no good.
                They tend to peter out. When I run into
                difficulties, I find I conclude with a few vague
                questions and then drift off to get a cup of
                tea.<br><br>Many published essays peter out in the same
                way.
                Particularly the sort written by the staff writers
                of newsmagazines. Outside writers tend to supply
                editorials of the defend-a-position variety, which
                make a beeline toward a rousing (and
                foreordained) conclusion. But the staff writers feel
                obliged to write something "balanced."
                Since they're writing for a popular magazine, they start
                with the
                most radioactively controversial questions, from which —
                because
                they're writing for a popular magazine — they
                then proceed to recoil in terror.
                Abortion, for or against?
                This group says one thing. That group says
                another. One thing is certain: the question is a
                complex one. (But don't get mad at us. We didn't
                draw any conclusions.)<br><br><b>The
                        River</b><br><br>Questions aren't enough. An
                essay has to come up with answers.
                They don't always, of course. Sometimes you start with a
                promising question and get nowhere. But those you don't
                publish. Those are like experiments that get
                inconclusive
                results. An essay you publish ought to tell the reader
                something he didn't already know.<br><br>But <i>what</i>
                you tell him doesn't matter, so long as
                it's interesting. I'm sometimes accused of meandering.
                In defend-a-position writing that would be a flaw.
                There you're not concerned with truth. You already
                know where you're going, and you want to go straight
                there,
                blustering through obstacles, and hand-waving
                your way across swampy ground. But that's not what
                you're trying to do in an essay. An essay is supposed to
                be a search for truth. It would be suspicious if it
                didn't
                meander.<br><br>The Meander (aka Menderes) is a river in
                Turkey.
                As you might expect, it winds all over the place.
                But it doesn't do this out of frivolity.
                The path it has discovered is the most
                economical route to the sea. [6]<br><br>The river's
                algorithm is simple. At each step, flow down.
                For the essayist this translates to: flow interesting.
                Of all the places to go next, choose the most
                interesting.
                One can't have quite as little foresight as a river. I
                always
                know generally what I want to write about.
                But not the
                specific conclusions I want to reach; from paragraph to
                paragraph I let the ideas take their course.<br><br>This
                doesn't always work. Sometimes, like a river,
                one runs up against a wall. Then I do the same thing the
                river does:
                backtrack. At one point in this essay
                I found that after following a certain thread I ran out
                of ideas. I had to go back seven paragraphs and start
                over
                in another direction.<br><br>Fundamentally an essay is a
                train of thought — but a cleaned-up
                train of thought, as dialogue is cleaned-up
                conversation.
                Real thought, like real conversation, is full of false
                starts.
                It would be exhausting to read. You need to
                cut and fill to
                emphasize the central thread, like an
                illustrator inking over a pencil drawing. But don't
                change so much that you lose the spontaneity of the
                original.<br><br>Err on the side of the river. An essay
                is not a reference
                work. It's not something you read looking for a specific
                answer, and feel cheated if you don't find it. I'd much
                rather read an essay that went off in an unexpected but
                interesting direction than one that plodded dutifully
                along
                a prescribed course.<br><br><b>Surprise</b><br><br>So
                what's interesting? For me, interesting means surprise.
                Interfaces, as Geoffrey James has said, should follow
                the principle of
                least astonishment. A button that looks like it will
                make a
                machine stop should make it stop, not speed up. Essays
                should do the opposite. Essays should aim for maximum
                surprise.<br><br>I was afraid of flying for a long time
                and could only travel
                vicariously. When friends came back from faraway places,
                it wasn't just out of politeness that I asked
                what they saw. I really wanted to know. And I found
                the best way to get information out of them was to ask
                what surprised them. How was the place different from
                what
                they expected? This is an extremely useful question.
                You can ask it of the most unobservant people, and it
                will
                extract information they didn't even know they were
                recording.<br><br>Surprises are things that you not only
                didn't know, but that
                contradict things you
                thought you knew. And so they're the most valuable sort
                of
                fact you can get. They're like a food that's not merely
                healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy effects of things
                you've already eaten.<br><br>How do you find surprises?
                Well, therein lies half
                the work of essay writing. (The other half is expressing
                yourself well.) The trick is to use yourself as a
                proxy for the reader. You should only write about things
                you've thought about a lot. And anything you come across
                that surprises you, who've thought about the topic a
                lot,
                will probably surprise most readers.<br><br>For example,
                in a recent
                <a href="gh.html">essay</a> I pointed out that because
                you can only judge computer programmers by working with
                them, no one knows who the best programmers are overall.
                I didn't realize this when I began
                that essay, and even now I find it kind of weird. That's
                what you're looking for.<br><br>So if you want to write
                essays, you need two ingredients:
                a few topics you've thought about a lot, and
                some ability to ferret out the unexpected.<br><br>What
                should you think about? My guess is that it
                doesn't matter — that anything can be interesting if you
                get deeply
                enough into it. One possible exception might be things
                that have deliberately had all the variation sucked out
                of them,
                like working in fast food. In retrospect, was there
                anything interesting about working at Baskin-Robbins?
                Well, it was interesting how important color was
                to the customers. Kids a certain age would point into
                the case and say that they wanted yellow. Did they want
                French Vanilla or Lemon? They would just look at you
                blankly. They wanted yellow. And then there was the
                mystery of why the perennial favorite Pralines 'n' Cream
                was so appealing. (I think now it was the salt.)
                <!--And the mystery of why Passion Fruit tasted so awful.
People would order it because of the name, and were always
disappointed.-->
                And the difference in the way fathers and
                mothers bought ice cream for their kids: the fathers
                like benevolent kings bestowing largesse, the mothers
                harried, giving in to pressure.
                So, yes, there does seem to be some material even in
                fast food.<br><br>I didn't notice those things at the
                time, though. At sixteen
                I was about as observant as a lump of rock. I can see
                more now in
                the fragments of memory I preserve of that age than I
                could see
                at the time from having it all happening live, right in
                front of me.<br><br><b>Observation</b><br><br>So the
                ability to ferret out the unexpected must not merely be
                an
                inborn one. It must be something you can learn.
                How do you learn it?<br><br>To some extent it's like
                learning history.
                When you first read
                history, it's just a whirl of names
                and dates.
                Nothing seems to stick. But the more you learn, the more
                hooks you have
                for new facts to stick onto — which means
                you accumulate knowledge at an exponential rate. Once
                you
                remember that Normans conquered
                England in 1066, it will catch your attention when you
                hear
                that other Normans conquered southern Italy at about the
                same time.
                Which will make you wonder about Normandy, and take note
                when a third book mentions that Normans
                were not, like most of what is now
                called France, tribes that flowed in as the Roman empire
                collapsed,
                but Vikings (norman = north man) who arrived
                four centuries later in 911. Which makes
                it easier to remember that Dublin was also established
                by
                Vikings in the 840s. Etc, etc squared.<br><br>Collecting
                surprises is a similar process.
                The more anomalies you've seen, the more easily you'll
                notice
                new ones. Which means, oddly enough, that as you grow
                older,
                life should become more and more surprising. When I was
                a
                kid, I used to think adults had it all figured out.
                I had it backwards. Kids are the ones who have it all
                figured
                out. They're just mistaken.<br><br>When it comes to
                surprises, the rich get richer. But
                (as with wealth) there
                may be habits of mind that will help the process along.
                It's
                good to have a habit of asking questions, especially
                questions
                beginning with Why.
                But not in the random way that three year
                olds ask why. There are an infinite number of questions.
                How do you find the fruitful ones?<br><br>I find it
                especially
                useful to ask why about things that seem wrong.
                For example, why should there be a connection between
                humor and misfortune? Why do we find it funny when a
                character, even one we like, slips on a banana peel?
                There's a whole essay's worth of surprises there for
                sure.<br><br>If you want to notice things that seem
                wrong, you'll find a
                degree of skepticism helpful. I take it as an axiom
                that we're only achieving 1% of what we could.
                This helps counteract the rule that gets beaten into our
                heads as children: that things are the way they are
                because
                that is how things have to be.
                For example, everyone I've talked to while writing this
                essay
                felt the same about
                English classes — that the whole process seemed
                pointless.
                But none of us had the balls at the time to hypothesize
                that
                it was, in fact, all a mistake.
                We all thought there was just something we weren't
                getting.<br><br>I have a hunch you want to pay attention
                not just to things
                that seem wrong, but things that seem wrong in a
                humorous way.
                I'm always pleased when I see someone laugh as they
                read a draft of an essay. But why should I be? I'm
                aiming
                for good ideas. Why should good ideas be funny?
                The connection may be surprise.
                Surprises make us laugh, and surprises are what
                one wants to deliver.<br><br>I write down things that
                surprise me in notebooks. I never
                actually get around to reading them and using
                what I've written, but I do tend to
                reproduce the same thoughts later. So the main value
                of notebooks may be what writing things down leaves in
                your
                head.<br><br>People trying to be cool will find
                themselves at a disadvantage
                when collecting surprises. To be surprised is to be
                mistaken.
                And the essence of cool, as any fourteen year old could
                tell
                you, is <i>nil admirari.</i> When you're mistaken, don't
                dwell on it; just act like nothing's wrong and maybe no
                one
                will notice.<br><br>One of the keys to coolness is to
                avoid situations where
                inexperience may make you look foolish.
                If you want to find surprises you should do the
                opposite.
                Study lots of different things,
                because some of the most interesting surprises are
                unexpected
                connections between different fields. For example,
                jam, bacon, pickles, and cheese, which are among the
                most pleasing
                of foods, were all originally intended as methods of
                preservation.
                And so were books and paintings.<br><br>Whatever you
                study, include history — but social and economic
                history, not political history. History seems to me so
                important
                that it's misleading to treat it as a mere field of
                study.
                Another way to describe it is <i>all the data we have so
                        far.</i><br><br>Among other things, studying
                history gives one confidence that
                there are good ideas waiting to be discovered right
                under our noses.
                Swords evolved during the Bronze Age out of daggers,
                which
                (like their flint predecessors) had a hilt separate from
                the
                blade. Because swords are longer
                the hilts kept breaking off. But it took five hundred
                years
                before someone thought of casting hilt and blade as one
                piece.<br><br><b>Disobedience</b><br><br>Above all, make
                a habit of paying
                attention to things you're not supposed to, either
                because
                they're "<a href="say.html">inappropriate</a>,"
                or not important, or not what you're
                supposed to be working on. If you're curious about
                something,
                trust your instincts.
                Follow the threads that attract your
                attention. If there's something you're really interested
                in, you'll find they have an uncanny way of leading back
                to
                it anyway, just as the conversation of people who are
                especially
                proud of something always tends to lead back to
                it.<br><br>For example, I've always been fascinated by
                comb-overs, especially
                the extreme sort that
                make a man look as if he's wearing a beret made of his
                own hair.
                Surely this is a lowly sort of thing to be interested in
                — the
                sort of superficial quizzing
                best left to teenage girls. And yet there is something
                underneath.
                The key question, I realized, is how does the
                comber-over not
                see how odd he looks?
                And the answer is that he got to look that way
                <i>incrementally.</i>
                What began as combing his hair a little carefully over a
                thin patch has gradually, over 20 years, grown into a
                monstrosity.
                Gradualness is very powerful. And that power can be
                used for constructive purposes too: just as you can
                trick
                yourself into looking like a freak, you can trick
                yourself into
                creating something so grand that you would never have
                dared to
                <i>plan</i> such a thing. Indeed, this is just how most
                good
                software gets created. You start by writing a
                stripped-down
                kernel (how hard can it be?) and gradually it grows
                into a complete operating system. Hence the next leap:
                could
                you do the same thing in painting, or in a
                novel?<br><br>See what you can extract from a frivolous
                question?
                If there's one piece of advice I would give about
                writing essays,
                it would be: don't do as you're told.
                Don't believe what you're supposed to.
                Don't write the
                essay readers expect; one learns nothing from
                what one expects.
                And
                don't write the way they taught you to in
                school.<br><br>The most important sort of disobedience
                is to write
                essays at all. Fortunately, this sort of disobedience
                shows
                signs of becoming

                It used to be that only a tiny
                number of officially approved writers were allowed to
                write essays. Magazines published few of them, and
                judged
                them less by what they said than who wrote them;
                a magazine might publish a story by an
                unknown writer if it was good enough, but if they
                published
                an essay on x it had to be by someone who was at least
                forty and whose job title had x in it. Which is a
                problem,
                because there are a lot of things insiders can't say

                changing that.
                Anyone can publish an essay on the Web, and it gets
                judged, as any
                writing should, by what it says, not who wrote it.
                Who are you to write about x? You are whatever you
                wrote.<br><br>Popular magazines made the period between
                the spread
                of literacy and the arrival of TV the golden age of the
                short story.
                The Web may well make this the golden age of the essay.
                And that's certainly not something I realized when
                I started writing
                this.<br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[1] I'm
                thinking of Oresme (c. 1323-82). But it's hard to pick
                a date, because there was a sudden drop-off in
                scholarship
                just as Europeans finished assimilating classical
                science.
                The cause may have been the plague of 1347; the trend in
                scientific progress matches the population
                curve.<br><br>[2] Parker, William R. "Where Do College

                At first
                literature took a back seat to philology, which (a)
                seemed more
                serious and (b) was popular in Germany, where many of
                the
                leading scholars of that generation had been
                trained.<br><br>In some cases the writing teachers were
                transformed
                <i>in situ</i> into English professors.
                Francis James Child, who had been Boylston Professor
                of Rhetoric at Harvard since 1851,
                became in 1876 the university's first professor of
                English.<br><br>[4] Parker, <i>op. cit.</i>, p.
                25.<br><br>[5] The undergraduate curriculum or
                <i>trivium</i> (whence
                "trivial") consisted of Latin grammar, rhetoric, and
                logic.
                Candidates for masters' degrees went on to study the
                <i>quadrivium</i> of arithmetic, geometry, music, and
                astronomy.
                Together these were the seven liberal arts.<br><br>The
                study of rhetoric was inherited directly from Rome,
                where
                it was considered the most important
                subject. It would not be far from the truth to say that
                education in the classical world
                meant training landowners' sons
                to speak well enough to defend their interests
                in political and legal disputes.<br><br>[6] Trevor
                Blackwell points out that this
                isn't strictly true, because the outside
                edges of curves erode faster.<br><br>
                <!--[9] When I first heard about blogs, I imagined they would be a
complete waste of time.  Blogging sounded like a long-play version 
of netnews.  But I was mistaken; people care more about something
that stays on their site, and the Web supplies a filter that's  
missing in newsgroups.
The best writing online
is not only better than netnews, but better than most print media.-->
