        <article>Talk at Bellcore, 7 March 1986<br><br>The title of my
                talk is "You and Your Research." It is not about
                managing research, it is about how you individually do
                your research. I could give a talk on the other subject
                — but it's not, it's about you. I'm not talking about
                ordinary run-of-the-mill research; I'm talking about
                great research. And for the sake of describing great
                research I'll occasionally say Nobel-Prize type of work.
                It doesn't have to gain the Nobel Prize, but I mean
                those kinds of things which we perceive are significant
                things. Relativity, if you want, Shannon's information
                theory, any number of outstanding theories — that's the
                kind of thing I'm talking about.<br><br>Now, how did I
                come to do this study? At Los Alamos I was brought in to
                run the computing machines which other people had got
                going, so those scientists and physicists could get back
                to business. I saw I was a stooge. I saw that although
                physically I was the same, they were different. And to
                put the thing bluntly, I was envious. I wanted to know
                why they were so different from me. I saw Feynman up
                close. I saw Fermi and Teller. I saw Oppenheimer. I saw
                Hans Bethe: he was my boss. I saw quite a few very
                capable people. I became very interested in the
                difference between those who do and those who might have
                done.<br><br>When I came to Bell Labs, I came into a
                very productive department. Bode was the department head
                at the time; Shannon was there, and there were other
                people. I continued examining the questions, "Why?" and
                "What is the difference?" I continued subsequently by
                reading biographies, autobiographies, asking people
                questions such as: "How did you come to do this?" I
                tried to find out what are the differences. And that's
                what this talk is about.<br><br>Now, why is this talk
                important? I think it is important because, as far as I
                know, each of you has one life to live. Even if you
                believe in reincarnation it doesn't do you any good from
                one life to the next! Why shouldn't you do significant
                things in this one life, however you define significant?
                I'm not going to define it — you know what I mean. I
                will talk mainly about science because that is what I
                have studied. But so far as I know, and I've been told
                by others, much of what I say applies to many fields.
                Outstanding work is characterized very much the same way
                in most fields, but I will confine myself to
                science.<br><br>In order to get at you individually, I
                must talk in the first person. I have to get you to drop
                modesty and say to yourself, "Yes, I would like to do
                first-class work." Our society frowns on people who set
                out to do really good work. You're not supposed to; luck
                is supposed to descend on you and you do great things by
                chance. Well, that's a kind of dumb thing to say. I say,
                why shouldn't you set out to do something significant.
                You don't have to tell other people, but shouldn't you
                say to yourself, "Yes, I would like to do something
                significant."<br><br>In order to get to the second
                stage, I have to drop modesty and talk in the first
                person about what I've seen, what I've done, and what
                I've heard. I'm going to talk about people, some of whom
                you know, and I trust that when we leave, you won't
                quote me as saying some of the things I said.<br><br>Let
                me start not logically, but psychologically. I find that
                the major objection is that people think great science
                is done by luck. It's all a matter of luck. Well,
                consider Einstein. Note how many different things he did
                that were good. Was it all luck? Wasn't it a little too
                repetitive? Consider Shannon. He didn't do just
                information theory. Several years before, he did some
                other good things and some which are still locked up in
                the security of cryptography. He did many good
                things.<br><br>You see again and again that it is more
                than one thing from a good person. Once in a while a
                person does only one thing in his whole life, and we'll
                talk about that later, but a lot of times there is
                repetition. I claim that luck will not cover everything.
                And I will cite Pasteur who said, "Luck favors the
                prepared mind." And I think that says it the way I
                believe it. There is indeed an element of luck, and no,
                there isn't. The prepared mind sooner or later finds
                something important and does it. So yes, it is luck. The
                particular thing you do is luck, but that you do
                something is not.<br><br>For example, when I came to
                Bell Labs, I shared an office for a while with Shannon.
                At the same time he was doing information theory, I was
                doing coding theory. It is suspicious that the two of us
                did it at the same place and at the same time — it was
                in the atmosphere. And you can say, "Yes, it was luck."
                On the other hand you can say, "But why of all the
                people in Bell Labs then were those the two who did it?"
                Yes, it is partly luck, and partly it is the prepared
                mind; but "partly" is the other thing I'm going to talk
                about. So, although I'll come back several more times to
                luck, I want to dispose of this matter of luck as being
                the sole criterion whether you do great work or not. I
                claim you have some, but not total, control over it. And
                I will quote, finally, Newton on the matter. Newton
                said, "If others would think as hard as I did, then they
                would get similar results."<br><br>One of the
                characteristics you see, and many people have it
                including great scientists, is that usually when they
                were young they had independent thoughts and had the
                courage to pursue them. For example, Einstein, somewhere
                around 12 or 14, asked himself the question, "What would
                a light wave look like if I went with the velocity of
                light to look at it?" Now he knew that electromagnetic
                theory says you cannot have a stationary local maximum.
                But if he moved along with the velocity of light, he
                would see a local maximum. He could see a contradiction
                at the age of 12, 14, or somewhere around there, that
                everything was not right and that the velocity of light
                had something peculiar. Is it luck that he finally
                created special relativity? Early on, he had laid down
                some of the pieces by thinking of the fragments. Now
                that's the necessary but not sufficient condition. All
                of these items I will talk about are both luck and not
                luck.<br><br>How about having lots of brains? It sounds
                good. Most of you in this room probably have more than
                enough brains to do first-class work. But great work is
                something else than mere brains. Brains are measured in
                various ways. In mathematics, theoretical physics,
                astrophysics, typically brains correlates to a great
                extent with the ability to manipulate symbols. And so
                the typical IQ test is apt to score them fairly high. On
                the other hand, in other fields it is something
                different. For example, Bill Pfann, the fellow who did
                zone melting, came into my office one day. He had this
                idea dimly in his mind about what he wanted and he had
                some equations. It was pretty clear to me that this man
                didn't know much mathematics and he wasn't really
                articulate. His problem seemed interesting so I took it
                home and did a little work. I finally showed him how to
                run computers so he could compute his own answers. I
                gave him the power to compute. He went ahead, with
                negligible recognition from his own department, but
                ultimately he has collected all the prizes in the field.
                Once he got well started, his shyness, his awkwardness,
                his inarticulateness, fell away and he became much more
                productive in many other ways. Certainly he became much
                more articulate.<br><br>And I can cite another person in
                the same way. I trust he isn't in the audience, i.e. a
                fellow named Clogston. I met him when I was working on a
                problem with John Pierce's group and I didn't think he
                had much. I asked my friends who had been with him at
                school, "Was he like that in graduate school?" "Yes,"
                they replied. Well I would have fired the fellow, but J.
                R. Pierce was smart and kept him on. Clogston finally
                did the Clogston cable. After that there was a steady
                stream of good ideas. One success brought him confidence
                and courage.<br><br>One of the characteristics of
                successful scientists is having courage. Once you get
                your courage up and believe that you can do important
                problems, then you can. If you think you can't, almost
                surely you are not going to. Courage is one of the
                things that Shannon had supremely. You have only to
                think of his major theorem. He wants to create a method
                of coding, but he doesn't know what to do so he makes a
                random code. Then he is stuck. And then he asks the
                impossible question, "What would the average random code
                do?" He then proves that the average code is arbitrarily
                good, and that therefore there must be at least one good
                code. Who but a man of infinite courage could have dared
                to think those thoughts? That is the characteristic of
                great scientists; they have courage. They will go
                forward under incredible circumstances; they think and
                continue to think.<br><br>Age is another factor which
                the physicists particularly worry about. They always are
                saying that you have got to do it when you are young or
                you will never do it. Einstein did things very early,
                and all the quantum mechanic fellows were disgustingly
                young when they did their best work. Most
                mathematicians, theoretical physicists, and
                astrophysicists do what we consider their best work when
                they are young. It is not that they don't do good work
                in their old age but what we value most is often what
                they did early. On the other hand, in music, politics
                and literature, often what we consider their best work
                was done late. I don't know how whatever field you are
                in fits this scale, but age has some effect.<br><br>But
                let me say why age seems to have the effect it does. In
                the first place if you do some good work you will find
                yourself on all kinds of committees and unable to do any
                more work. You may find yourself as I saw Brattain when
                he got a Nobel Prize. The day the prize was announced we
                all assembled in Arnold Auditorium; all three winners
                got up and made speeches. The third one, Brattain,
                practically with tears in his eyes, said, "I know about
                this Nobel-Prize effect and I am not going to let it
                affect me; I am going to remain good old Walter
                Brattain." Well I said to myself, "That is nice." But in
                a few weeks I saw it was affecting him. Now he could
                only work on great problems.<br><br>When you are famous
                it is hard to work on small problems. This is what did
                Shannon in. After information theory, what do you do for
                an encore? The great scientists often make this error.
                They fail to continue to plant the little acorns from
                which the mighty oak trees grow. They try to get the big
                thing right off. And that isn't the way things go. So
                that is another reason why you find that when you get
                early recognition it seems to sterilize you. In fact I
                will give you my favorite quotation of many years. The
                Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, in my
                opinion, has ruined more good scientists than any
                institution has created, judged by what they did before
                they came and judged by what they did after. Not that
                they weren't good afterwards, but they were superb
                before they got there and were only good
                afterwards.<br><br>This brings up the subject, out of
                order perhaps, of working conditions. What most people
                think are the best working conditions, are not. Very
                clearly they are not because people are often most
                productive when working conditions are bad. One of the
                better times of the Cambridge Physical Laboratories was
                when they had practically shacks — they did some of the
                best physics ever.<br><br>I give you a story from my own
                private life. Early on it became evident to me that Bell
                Laboratories was not going to give me the conventional
                acre of programming people to program computing machines
                in absolute binary. It was clear they weren't going to.
                But that was the way everybody did it. I could go to the
                West Coast and get a job with the airplane companies
                without any trouble, but the exciting people were at
                Bell Labs and the fellows out there in the airplane
                companies were not. I thought for a long while about,
                "Did I want to go or not?" and I wondered how I could
                get the best of two possible worlds. I finally said to
                myself, "Hamming, you think the machines can do
                practically everything. Why can't you make them write
                programs?" What appeared at first to me as a defect
                forced me into automatic programming very early. What
                appears to be a fault, often, by a change of viewpoint,
                turns out to be one of the greatest assets you can have.
                But you are not likely to think that when you first look
                the thing and say, "Gee, I'm never going to get enough
                programmers, so how can I ever do any great
                programming?"<br><br>And there are many other stories of
                the same kind; Grace Hopper has similar ones. I think
                that if you look carefully you will see that often the
                great scientists, by turning the problem around a bit,
                changed a defect to an asset. For example, many
                scientists when they found they couldn't do a problem
                finally began to study why not. They then turned it
                around the other way and said, "But of course, this is
                what it is" and got an important result. So ideal
                working conditions are very strange. The ones you want
                aren't always the best ones for you.<br><br>Now for the
                matter of drive. You observe that most great scientists
                have tremendous drive. I worked for ten years with John
                Tukey at Bell Labs. He had tremendous drive. One day
                about three or four years after I joined, I discovered
                that John Tukey was slightly younger than I was. John
                was a genius and I clearly was not. Well I went storming
                into Bode's office and said, "How can anybody my age
                know as much as John Tukey does?" He leaned back in his
                chair, put his hands behind his head, grinned slightly,
                and said, "You would be surprised Hamming, how much you
                would know if you worked as hard as he did that many
                years." I simply slunk out of the office!<br><br>What
                Bode was saying was this: Knowledge and productivity are
                like compound interest. Given two people of
                approximately the same ability and one person who works
                ten percent more than the other, the latter will more
                than twice outproduce the former. The more you know, the
                more you learn; the more you learn, the more you can do;
                the more you can do, the more the opportunity — it is
                very much like compound interest. I don't want to give
                you a rate, but it is a very high rate. Given two people
                with exactly the same ability, the one person who
                manages day in and day out to get in one more hour of
                thinking will be tremendously more productive over a
                lifetime. I took Bode's remark to heart; I spent a good
                deal more of my time for some years trying to work a bit
                harder and I found, in fact, I could get more work done.
                I don't like to say it in front of my wife, but I did
                sort of neglect her sometimes; I needed to study. You
                have to neglect things if you intend to get what you
                want done. There's no question about this.<br><br>On
                this matter of drive Edison says, "Genius is 99%
                perspiration and 1% inspiration." He may have been
                exaggerating, but the idea is that solid work, steadily
                applied, gets you surprisingly far. The steady
                application of effort with a little bit more work,
                intelligently applied is what does it. That's the
                trouble; drive, misapplied, doesn't get you anywhere.
                I've often wondered why so many of my good friends at
                Bell Labs who worked as hard or harder than I did,
                didn't have so much to show for it. The misapplication
                of effort is a very serious matter. Just hard work is
                not enough - it must be applied sensibly.<br><br>There's
                another trait on the side which I want to talk about;
                that trait is ambiguity. It took me a while to discover
                its importance. Most people like to believe something is
                or is not true. Great scientists tolerate ambiguity very
                well. They believe the theory enough to go ahead; they
                doubt it enough to notice the errors and faults so they
                can step forward and create the new replacement theory.
                If you believe too much you'll never notice the flaws;
                if you doubt too much you won't get started. It requires
                a lovely balance. But most great scientists are well
                aware of why their theories are true and they are also
                well aware of some slight misfits which don't quite fit
                and they don't forget it. Darwin writes in his
                autobiography that he found it necessary to write down
                every piece of evidence which appeared to contradict his
                beliefs because otherwise they would disappear from his
                mind. When you find apparent flaws you've got to be
                sensitive and keep track of those things, and keep an
                eye out for how they can be explained or how the theory
                can be changed to fit them. Those are often the great
                contributions. Great contributions are rarely done by
                adding another decimal place. It comes down to an
                emotional commitment. Most great scientists are
                completely committed to their problem. Those who don't
                become committed seldom produce outstanding, first-class
                work.<br><br>Now again, emotional commitment is not
                enough. It is a necessary condition apparently. And I
                think I can tell you the reason why. Everybody who has
                studied creativity is driven finally to saying,
                "creativity comes out of your subconscious." Somehow,
                suddenly, there it is. It just appears. Well, we know
                very little about the subconscious; but one thing you
                are pretty well aware of is that your dreams also come
                out of your subconscious. And you're aware your dreams
                are, to a fair extent, a reworking of the experiences of
                the day. If you are deeply immersed and committed to a
                topic, day after day after day, your subconscious has
                nothing to do but work on your problem. And so you wake
                up one morning, or on some afternoon, and there's the
                answer. For those who don't get committed to their
                current problem, the subconscious goofs off on other
                things and doesn't produce the big result. So the way to
                manage yourself is that when you have a real important
                problem you don't let anything else get the center of
                your attention — you keep your thoughts on the problem.
                Keep your subconscious starved so it has to work on your
                problem, so you can sleep peacefully and get the answer
                in the morning, free.<br><br>Now Alan Chynoweth
                mentioned that I used to eat at the physics table. I had
                been eating with the mathematicians and I found out that
                I already knew a fair amount of mathematics; in fact, I
                wasn't learning much. The physics table was, as he said,
                an exciting place, but I think he exaggerated on how
                much I contributed. It was very interesting to listen to
                Shockley, Brattain, Bardeen, J. B. Johnson, Ken McKay
                and other people, and I was learning a lot. But
                unfortunately a Nobel Prize came, and a promotion came,
                and what was left was the dregs. Nobody wanted what was
                left. Well, there was no use eating with
                them!<br><br>Over on the other side of the dining hall
                was a chemistry table. I had worked with one of the
                fellows, Dave McCall; furthermore he was courting our
                secretary at the time. I went over and said, "Do you
                mind if I join you?" They can't say no, so I started
                eating with them for a while. And I started asking,
                "What are the important problems of your field?" And
                after a week or so, "What important problems are you
                working on?" And after some more time I came in one day
                and said, "If what you are doing is not important, and
                if you don't think it is going to lead to something
                important, why are you at Bell Labs working on it?" I
                wasn't welcomed after that; I had to find somebody else
                to eat with! That was in the spring.<br><br>In the fall,
                Dave McCall stopped me in the hall and said, "Hamming,
                that remark of yours got underneath my skin. I thought
                about it all summer, i.e. what were the important
                problems in my field. I haven't changed my research," he
                says, "but I think it was well worthwhile." And I said,
                "Thank you Dave," and went on. I noticed a couple of
                months later he was made the head of the department. I
                noticed the other day he was a Member of the National
                Academy of Engineering. I noticed he has succeeded. I
                have never heard the names of any of the other fellows
                at that table mentioned in science and scientific
                circles. They were unable to ask themselves, "What are
                the important problems in my field?"<br><br>If you do
                not work on an important problem, it's unlikely you'll
                do important work. It's perfectly obvious. Great
                scientists have thought through, in a careful way, a
                number of important problems in their field, and they
                keep an eye on wondering how to attack them. Let me warn
                you, "important problem" must be phrased carefully. The
                three outstanding problems in physics, in a certain
                sense, were never worked on while I was at Bell Labs. By
                important I mean guaranteed a Nobel Prize and any sum of
                money you want to mention. We didn't work on (1) time
                travel, (2) teleportation, and (3) antigravity. They are
                not important problems because we do not have an attack.
                It's not the consequence that makes a problem important,
                it is that you have a reasonable attack. That is what
                makes a problem important. When I say that most
                scientists don't work on important problems, I mean it
                in that sense. The average scientist, so far as I can
                make out, spends almost all his time working on problems
                which he believes will not be important and he also
                doesn't believe that they will lead to important
                problems.<br><br>I spoke earlier about planting acorns
                so that oaks will grow. You can't always know exactly
                where to be, but you can keep active in places where
                something might happen. And even if you believe that
                great science is a matter of luck, you can stand on a
                mountain top where lightning strikes; you don't have to
                hide in the valley where you're safe. But the average
                scientist does routine safe work almost all the time and
                so he (or she) doesn't produce much. It's that simple.
                If you want to do great work, you clearly must work on
                important problems, and you should have an
                idea.<br><br>Along those lines at some urging from John
                Tukey and others, I finally adopted what I called "Great
                Thoughts Time." When I went to lunch Friday noon, I
                would only discuss great thoughts after that. By great
                thoughts I mean ones like: "What will be the role of
                computers in all of AT&T?", "How will computers change
                science?" For example, I came up with the observation at
                that time that nine out of ten experiments were done in
                the lab and one in ten on the computer. I made a remark
                to the vice presidents one time, that it would be
                reversed, i.e. nine out of ten experiments would be done
                on the computer and one in ten in the lab. They knew I
                was a crazy mathematician and had no sense of reality. I
                knew they were wrong and they've been proved wrong while
                I have been proved right. They built laboratories when
                they didn't need them. I saw that computers were
                transforming science because I spent a lot of time
                asking "What will be the impact of computers on science
                and how can I change it?" I asked myself, "How is it
                going to change Bell Labs?" I remarked one time, in the
                same address, that more than one-half of the people at
                Bell Labs will be interacting closely with computing
                machines before I leave. Well, you all have terminals
                now. I thought hard about where was my field going,
                where were the opportunities, and what were the
                important things to do. Let me go there so there is a
                chance I can do important things.<br><br>Most great
                scientists know many important problems. They have
                something between 10 and 20 important problems for which
                they are looking for an attack. And when they see a new
                idea come up, one hears them say "Well that bears on
                this problem." They drop all the other things and get
                after it. Now I can tell you a horror story that was
                told to me but I can't vouch for the truth of it. I was
                sitting in an airport talking to a friend of mine from
                Los Alamos about how it was lucky that the fission
                experiment occurred over in Europe when it did because
                that got us working on the atomic bomb here in the US.
                He said "No; at Berkeley we had gathered a bunch of
                data; we didn't get around to reducing it because we
                were building some more equipment, but if we had reduced
                that data we would have found fission." They had it in
                their hands and they didn't pursue it. They came in
                second!<br><br>The great scientists, when an opportunity
                opens up, get after it and they pursue it. They drop all
                other things. They get rid of other things and they get
                after an idea because they had already thought the thing
                through. Their minds are prepared; they see the
                opportunity and they go after it. Now of course lots of
                times it doesn't work out, but you don't have to hit
                many of them to do some great science. It's kind of
                easy. One of the chief tricks is to live a long
                time!<br><br>Another trait, it took me a while to
                notice. I noticed the following facts about people who
                work with the door open or the door closed. I notice
                that if you have the door to your office closed, you get
                more work done today and tomorrow, and you are more
                productive than most. But 10 years later somehow you
                don't know quite know what problems are worth working
                on; all the hard work you do is sort of tangential in
                importance. He who works with the door open gets all
                kinds of interruptions, but he also occasionally gets
                clues as to what the world is and what might be
                important. Now I cannot prove the cause and effect
                sequence because you might say, "The closed door is
                symbolic of a closed mind." I don't know. But I can say
                there is a pretty good correlation between those who
                work with the doors open and those who ultimately do
                important things, although people who work with doors
                closed often work harder. Somehow they seem to work on
                slightly the wrong thing — not much, but enough that
                they miss fame.<br><br>I want to talk on another topic.
                It is based on the song which I think many of you know,
                "It ain't what you do, it's the way that you do it."
                I'll start with an example of my own. I was conned into
                doing on a digital computer, in the absolute binary
                days, a problem which the best analog computers couldn't
                do. And I was getting an answer. When I thought
                carefully and said to myself, "You know, Hamming, you're
                going to have to file a report on this military job;
                after you spend a lot of money you're going to have to
                account for it and every analog installation is going to
                want the report to see if they can't find flaws in it."
                I was doing the required integration by a rather crummy
                method, to say the least, but I was getting the answer.
                And I realized that in truth the problem was not just to
                get the answer; it was to demonstrate for the first
                time, and beyond question, that I could beat the analog
                computer on its own ground with a digital machine. I
                reworked the method of solution, created a theory which
                was nice and elegant, and changed the way we computed
                the answer; the results were no different. The published
                report had an elegant method which was later known for
                years as "Hamming's Method of Integrating Differential
                Equations." It is somewhat obsolete now, but for a while
                it was a very good method. By changing the problem
                slightly, I did important work rather than trivial
                work.<br><br>In the same way, when using the machine up
                in the attic in the early days, I was solving one
                problem after another after another; a fair number were
                successful and there were a few failures. I went home
                one Friday after finishing a problem, and curiously
                enough I wasn't happy; I was depressed. I could see life
                being a long sequence of one problem after another after
                another. After quite a while of thinking I decided, "No,
                I should be in the mass production of a variable
                product. I should be concerned with all of next year's
                problems, not just the one in front of my face." By
                changing the question I still got the same kind of
                results or better, but I changed things and did
                important work. I attacked the major problem — How do I
                conquer machines and do all of next year's problems when
                I don't know what they are going to be? How do I prepare
                for it? How do I do this one so I'll be on top of it?
                How do I obey Newton's rule? He said, "If I have seen
                further than others, it is because I've stood on the
                shoulders of giants." These days we stand on each
                other's feet!<br><br>You should do your job in such a
                fashion that others can build on top of it, so they will
                indeed say, "Yes, I've stood on so and so's shoulders
                and I saw further." The essence of science is
                cumulative. By changing a problem slightly you can often
                do great work rather than merely good work. Instead of
                attacking isolated problems, I made the resolution that
                I would never again solve an isolated problem except as
                characteristic of a class.<br><br>Now if you are much of
                a mathematician you know that the effort to generalize
                often means that the solution is simple. Often by
                stopping and saying, "This is the problem he wants but
                this is characteristic of so and so. Yes, I can attack
                the whole class with a far superior method than the
                particular one because I was earlier embedded in
                needless detail." The business of abstraction frequently
                makes things simple. Furthermore, I filed away the
                methods and prepared for the future problems.<br><br>To
                end this part, I'll remind you, "It is a poor workman
                who blames his tools — the good man gets on with the
                job, given what he's got, and gets the best answer he
                can." And I suggest that by altering the problem, by
                looking at the thing differently, you can make a great
                deal of difference in your final productivity because
                you can either do it in such a fashion that people can
                indeed build on what you've done, or you can do it in
                such a fashion that the next person has to essentially
                duplicate again what you've done. It isn't just a matter
                of the job, it's the way you write the report, the way
                you write the paper, the whole attitude. It's just as
                easy to do a broad, general job as one very special
                case. And it's much more satisfying and
                rewarding!<br><br>I have now come down to a topic which
                is very distasteful; it is not sufficient to do a job,
                you have to sell it. "Selling" to a scientist is an
                awkward thing to do. It's very ugly; you shouldn't have
                to do it. The world is supposed to be waiting, and when
                you do something great, they should rush out and welcome
                it. But the fact is everyone is busy with their own
                work. You must present it so well that they will set
                aside what they are doing, look at what you've done,
                read it, and come back and say, "Yes, that was good." I
                suggest that when you open a journal, as you turn the
                pages, you ask why you read some articles and not
                others. You had better write your report so when it is
                published in the Physical Review, or wherever else you
                want it, as the readers are turning the pages they won't
                just turn your pages but they will stop and read yours.
                If they don't stop and read it, you won't get
                credit.<br><br>There are three things you have to do in
                selling. You have to learn to write clearly and well so
                that people will read it, you must learn to give
                reasonably formal talks, and you also must learn to give
                informal talks. We had a lot of so-called 'back room
                scientists.' In a conference, they would keep quiet.
                Three weeks later after a decision was made they filed a
                report saying why you should do so and so. Well, it was
                too late. They would not stand up right in the middle of
                a hot conference, in the middle of activity, and say,
                "We should do this for these reasons." You need to
                master that form of communication as well as prepared
                speeches.<br><br>When I first started, I got practically
                physically ill while giving a speech, and I was very,
                very nervous. I realized I either had to learn to give
                speeches smoothly or I would essentially partially
                cripple my whole career. The first time IBM asked me to
                give a speech in New York one evening, I decided I was
                going to give a really good speech, a speech that was
                wanted, not a technical one but a broad one, and at the
                end if they liked it, I'd quietly say, "Any time you
                want one I'll come in and give you one." As a result, I
                got a great deal of practice giving speeches to a
                limited audience and I got over being afraid.
                Furthermore, I could also then study what methods were
                effective and what were ineffective.<br><br>While going
                to meetings I had already been studying why some papers
                are remembered and most are not. The technical person
                wants to give a highly limited technical talk. Most of
                the time the audience wants a broad general talk and
                wants much more survey and background than the speaker
                is willing to give. As a result, many talks are
                ineffective. The speaker names a topic and suddenly
                plunges into the details he's solved. Few people in the
                audience may follow. You should paint a general picture
                to say why it's important, and then slowly give a sketch
                of what was done. Then a larger number of people will
                say, "Yes, Joe has done that," or "Mary has done that; I
                really see where it is; yes, Mary really gave a good
                talk; I understand what Mary has done." The tendency is
                to give a highly restricted, safe talk; this is usually
                ineffective. Furthermore, many talks are filled with far
                too much information. So I say this idea of selling is
                obvious.<br><br>Let me summarize. You've got to work on
                important problems. I deny that it is all luck, but I
                admit there is a fair element of luck. I subscribe to
                Pasteur's "Luck favors the prepared mind." I favor
                heavily what I did. Friday afternoons for years — great
                thoughts only — means that I committed 10% of my time
                trying to understand the bigger problems in the field,
                i.e. what was and what was not important. I found in the
                early days I had believed 'this' and yet had spent all
                week marching in 'that' direction. It was kind of
                foolish. If I really believe the action is over there,
                why do I march in this direction? I either had to change
                my goal or change what I did. So I changed something I
                did and I marched in the direction I thought was
                important. It's that easy.<br><br>Now you might tell me
                you haven't got control over what you have to work on.
                Well, when you first begin, you may not. But once you're
                moderately successful, there are more people asking for
                results than you can deliver and you have some power of
                choice, but not completely. I'll tell you a story about
                that, and it bears on the subject of educating your
                boss. I had a boss named Schelkunoff; he was, and still
                is, a very good friend of mine. Some military person
                came to me and demanded some answers by Friday. Well, I
                had already dedicated my computing resources to reducing
                data on the fly for a group of scientists; I was knee
                deep in short, small, important problems. This military
                person wanted me to solve his problem by the end of the
                day on Friday. I said, "No, I'll give it to you Monday.
                I can work on it over the weekend. I'm not going to do
                it now." He goes down to my boss, Schelkunoff, and
                Schelkunoff says, "You must run this for him; he's got
                to have it by Friday." I tell him, "Why do I?" He says,
                "You have to." I said, "Fine, Sergei, but you're sitting
                in your office Friday afternoon catching the late bus
                home to watch as this fellow walks out that door." I
                gave the military person the answers late Friday
                afternoon. I then went to Schelkunoff's office and sat
                down; as the man goes out I say, "You see Schelkunoff,
                this fellow has nothing under his arm; but I gave him
                the answers." On Monday morning Schelkunoff called him
                up and said, "Did you come in to work over the weekend?"
                I could hear, as it were, a pause as the fellow ran
                through his mind of what was going to happen; but he
                knew he would have had to sign in, and he'd better not
                say he had when he hadn't, so he said he hadn't. Ever
                after that Schelkunoff said, "You set your deadlines;
                you can change them."<br><br>One lesson was sufficient
                to educate my boss as to why I didn't want to do big
                jobs that displaced exploratory research and why I was
                justified in not doing crash jobs which absorb all the
                research computing facilities. I wanted instead to use
                the facilities to compute a large number of small
                problems. Again, in the early days, I was limited in
                computing capacity and it was clear, in my area, that a
                "mathematician had no use for machines." But I needed
                more machine capacity. Every time I had to tell some
                scientist in some other area, "No I can't; I haven't the
                machine capacity," he complained. I said "Go tell your
                Vice President that Hamming needs more computing
                capacity." After a while I could see what was happening
                up there at the top; many people said to my Vice
                President, "Your man needs more computing capacity." I
                got it!<br><br>I also did a second thing. When I loaned
                what little programming power we had to help in the
                early days of computing, I said, "We are not getting the
                recognition for our programmers that they deserve. When
                you publish a paper you will thank that programmer or
                you aren't getting any more help from me. That
                programmer is going to be thanked by name; she's worked
                hard." I waited a couple of years. I then went through a
                year of BSTJ articles and counted what fraction thanked
                some programmer. I took it into the boss and said,
                "That's the central role computing is playing in Bell
                Labs; if the BSTJ is important, that's how important
                computing is." He had to give in. You can educate your
                bosses. It's a hard job. In this talk I'm only viewing
                from the bottom up; I'm not viewing from the top down.
                But I am telling you how you can get what you want in
                spite of top management. You have to sell your ideas
                there also.<br><br>Well I now come down to the topic,
                "Is the effort to be a great scientist worth it?" To
                answer this, you must ask people. When you get beyond
                their modesty, most people will say, "Yes, doing really
                first-class work, and knowing it, is as good as wine,
                women and song put together," or if it's a woman she
                says, "It is as good as wine, men and song put
                together." And if you look at the bosses, they tend to
                come back or ask for reports, trying to participate in
                those moments of discovery. They're always in the way.
                So evidently those who have done it, want to do it
                again. But it is a limited survey. I have never dared to
                go out and ask those who didn't do great work how they
                felt about the matter. It's a biased sample, but I still
                think it is worth the struggle. I think it is very
                definitely worth the struggle to try and do first-class
                work because the truth is, the value is in the struggle
                more than it is in the result. The struggle to make
                something of yourself seems to be worthwhile in itself.
                The success and fame are sort of dividends, in my
                opinion.<br><br>I've told you how to do it. It is so
                easy, so why do so many people, with all their talents,
                fail? For example, my opinion, to this day, is that
                there are in the mathematics department at Bell Labs
                quite a few people far more able and far better endowed
                than I, but they didn't produce as much. Some of them
                did produce more than I did; Shannon produced more than
                I did, and some others produced a lot, but I was highly
                productive against a lot of other fellows who were
                better equipped. Why is it so? What happened to them?
                Why do so many of the people who have great promise,
                fail?<br><br>Well, one of the reasons is drive and
                commitment. The people who do great work with less
                ability but who are committed to it, get more done that
                those who have great skill and dabble in it, who work
                during the day and go home and do other things and come
                back and work the next day. They don't have the deep
                commitment that is apparently necessary for really
                first-class work. They turn out lots of good work, but
                we were talking, remember, about first-class work. There
                is a difference. Good people, very talented people,
                almost always turn out good work. We're talking about
                the outstanding work, the type of work that gets the
                Nobel Prize and gets recognition.<br><br>The second
                thing is, I think, the problem of personality defects.
                Now I'll cite a fellow whom I met out in Irvine. He had
                been the head of a computing center and he was
                temporarily on assignment as a special assistant to the
                president of the university. It was obvious he had a job
                with a great future. He took me into his office one time
                and showed me his method of getting letters done and how
                he took care of his correspondence. He pointed out how
                inefficient the secretary was. He kept all his letters
                stacked around there; he knew where everything was. And
                he would, on his word processor, get the letter out. He
                was bragging how marvelous it was and how he could get
                so much more work done without the secretary's
                interference. Well, behind his back, I talked to the
                secretary. The secretary said, "Of course I can't help
                him; I don't get his mail. He won't give me the stuff to
                log in; I don't know where he puts it on the floor. Of
                course I can't help him." So I went to him and said,
                "Look, if you adopt the present method and do what you
                can do single-handedly, you can go just that far and no
                farther than you can do single-handedly. If you will
                learn to work with the system, you can go as far as the
                system will support you." And, he never went any
                further. He had his personality defect of wanting total
                control and was not willing to recognize that you need
                the support of the system.<br><br>You find this
                happening again and again; good scientists will fight
                the system rather than learn to work with the system and
                take advantage of all the system has to offer. It has a
                lot, if you learn how to use it. It takes patience, but
                you can learn how to use the system pretty well, and you
                can learn how to get around it. After all, if you want a
                decision 'No', you just go to your boss and get a 'No'
                easy. If you want to do something, don't ask, do it.
                Present him with an accomplished fact. Don't give him a
                chance to tell you 'No'. But if you want a 'No', it's
                easy to get a 'No'.<br><br>Another personality defect is
                ego assertion and I'll speak in this case of my own
                experience. I came from Los Alamos and in the early days
                I was using a machine in New York at 590 Madison Avenue
                where we merely rented time. I was still dressing in
                western clothes, big slash pockets, a bolo and all those
                things. I vaguely noticed that I was not getting as good
                service as other people. So I set out to measure. You
                came in and you waited for your turn; I felt I was not
                getting a fair deal. I said to myself, "Why? No Vice
                President at IBM said, 'Give Hamming a bad time'. It is
                the secretaries at the bottom who are doing this. When a
                slot appears, they'll rush to find someone to slip in,
                but they go out and find somebody else. Now, why? I
                haven't mistreated them." Answer: I wasn't dressing the
                way they felt somebody in that situation should. It came
                down to just that — I wasn't dressing properly. I had to
                make the decision — was I going to assert my ego and
                dress the way I wanted to and have it steadily drain my
                effort from my professional life, or was I going to
                appear to conform better? I decided I would make an
                effort to appear to conform properly. The moment I did,
                I got much better service. And now, as an old colorful
                character, I get better service than other
                people.<br><br>You should dress according to the
                expectations of the audience spoken to. If I am going to
                give an address at the MIT computer center, I dress with
                a bolo and an old corduroy jacket or something else. I
                know enough not to let my clothes, my appearance, my
                manners get in the way of what I care about. An enormous
                number of scientists feel they must assert their ego and
                do their thing their way. They have got to be able to do
                this, that, or the other thing, and they pay a steady
                price.<br><br>John Tukey almost always dressed very
                casually. He would go into an important office and it
                would take a long time before the other fellow realized
                that this is a first-class man and he had better listen.
                For a long time John has had to overcome this kind of
                hostility. It's wasted effort! I didn't say you should
                conform; I said "The appearance of conforming gets you a
                long way." If you chose to assert your ego in any number
                of ways, "I am going to do it my way," you pay a small
                steady price throughout the whole of your professional
                career. And this, over a whole lifetime, adds up to an
                enormous amount of needless trouble.<br><br>By taking
                the trouble to tell jokes to the secretaries and being a
                little friendly, I got superb secretarial help. For
                instance, one time for some idiot reason all the
                reproducing services at Murray Hill were tied up. Don't
                ask me how, but they were. I wanted something done. My
                secretary called up somebody at Holmdel, hopped the
                company car, made the hour-long trip down and got it
                reproduced, and then came back. It was a payoff for the
                times I had made an effort to cheer her up, tell her
                jokes and be friendly; it was that little extra work
                that later paid off for me. By realizing you have to use
                the system and studying how to get the system to do your
                work, you learn how to adapt the system to your desires.
                Or you can fight it steadily, as a small undeclared war,
                for the whole of your life.<br><br>And I think John
                Tukey paid a terrible price needlessly. He was a genius
                anyhow, but I think it would have been far better, and
                far simpler, had he been willing to conform a little bit
                instead of ego asserting. He is going to dress the way
                he wants all of the time. It applies not only to dress
                but to a thousand other things; people will continue to
                fight the system. Not that you shouldn't
                occasionally!<br><br>When they moved the library from
                the middle of Murray Hill to the far end, a friend of
                mine put in a request for a bicycle. Well, the
                organization was not dumb. They waited awhile and sent
                back a map of the grounds saying, "Will you please
                indicate on this map what paths you are going to take so
                we can get an insurance policy covering you." A few more
                weeks went by. They then asked, "Where are you going to
                store the bicycle and how will it be locked so we can do
                so and so." He finally realized that of course he was
                going to be red-taped to death so he gave in. He rose to
                be the President of Bell Laboratories.<br><br>Barney
                Oliver was a good man. He wrote a letter one time to the
                IEEE. At that time the official shelf space at Bell Labs
                was so much and the height of the IEEE Proceedings at
                that time was larger; and since you couldn't change the
                size of the official shelf space he wrote this letter to
                the IEEE Publication person saying, since so many IEEE
                members were at Bell Labs and since the official space
                was so high the journal size should be changed. He sent
                it for his boss's signature. Back came a carbon with his
                signature, but he still doesn't know whether the
                original was sent or not. I am not saying you shouldn't
                make gestures of reform. I am saying that my study of
                able people is that they don't get themselves committed
                to that kind of warfare. They play it a little bit and
                drop it and get on with their work.<br><br>Many a
                second-rate fellow gets caught up in some little
                twitting of the system, and carries it through to
                warfare. He expends his energy in a foolish project. Now
                you are going to tell me that somebody has to change the
                system. I agree; somebody's has to. Which do you want to
                be? The person who changes the system or the person who
                does first-class science? Which person is it that you
                want to be? Be clear, when you fight the system and
                struggle with it, what you are doing, how far to go out
                of amusement, and how much to waste your effort fighting
                the system. My advice is to let somebody else do it and
                you get on with becoming a first-class scientist. Very
                few of you have the ability to both reform the system
                and become a first-class scientist.<br><br>On the other
                hand, we can't always give in. There are times when a
                certain amount of rebellion is sensible. I have observed
                almost all scientists enjoy a certain amount of twitting
                the system for the sheer love of it. What it comes down
                to basically is that you cannot be original in one area
                without having originality in others. Originality is
                being different. You can't be an original scientist
                without having some other original characteristics. But
                many a scientist has let his quirks in other places make
                him pay a far higher price than is necessary for the ego
                satisfaction he or she gets. I'm not against all ego
                assertion; I'm against some.<br><br>Another fault is
                anger. Often a scientist becomes angry, and this is no
                way to handle things. Amusement, yes, anger, no. Anger
                is misdirected. You should follow and cooperate rather
                than struggle against the system all the
                time.<br><br>Another thing you should look for is the
                positive side of things instead of the negative. I have
                already given you several examples, and there are many,
                many more; how, given the situation, by changing the way
                I looked at it, I converted what was apparently a defect
                to an asset. I'll give you another example. I am an
                egotistical person; there is no doubt about it. I knew
                that most people who took a sabbatical to write a book,
                didn't finish it on time. So before I left, I told all
                my friends that when I come back, that book was going to
                be done! Yes, I would have it done — I'd have been
                ashamed to come back without it! I used my ego to make
                myself behave the way I wanted to. I bragged about
                something so I'd have to perform. I found out many
                times, like a cornered rat in a real trap, I was
                surprisingly capable. I have found that it paid to say,
                "Oh yes, I'll get the answer for you Tuesday," not
                having any idea how to do it. By Sunday night I was
                really hard thinking on how I was going to deliver by
                Tuesday. I often put my pride on the line and sometimes
                I failed, but as I said, like a cornered rat I'm
                surprised how often I did a good job. I think you need
                to learn to use yourself. I think you need to know how
                to convert a situation from one view to another which
                would increase the chance of success.<br><br>Now
                self-delusion in humans is very, very common. There are
                innumerable ways of you changing a thing and kidding
                yourself and making it look some other way. When you
                ask, "Why didn't you do such and such," the person has a
                thousand alibis. If you look at the history of science,
                usually these days there are ten people right there
                ready, and we pay off for the person who is there first.
                The other nine fellows say, "Well, I had the idea but I
                didn't do it and so on and so on." There are so many
                alibis. Why weren't you first? Why didn't you do it
                right? Don't try an alibi. Don't try and kid yourself.
                You can tell other people all the alibis you want. I
                don't mind. But to yourself try to be honest.<br><br>If
                you really want to be a first-class scientist you need
                to know yourself, your weaknesses, your strengths, and
                your bad faults, like my egotism. How can you convert a
                fault to an asset? How can you convert a situation where
                you haven't got enough manpower to move into a direction
                when that's exactly what you need to do? I say again
                that I have seen, as I studied the history, the
                successful scientist changed the viewpoint and what was
                a defect became an asset.<br><br>In summary, I claim
                that some of the reasons why so many people who have
                greatness within their grasp don't succeed are: they
                don't work on important problems, they don't become
                emotionally involved, they don't try and change what is
                difficult to some other situation which is easily done
                but is still important, and they keep giving themselves
                alibis why they don't. They keep saying that it is a
                matter of luck. I've told you how easy it is;
                furthermore I've told you how to reform. Therefore, go
                forth and become great
                scientists!<br><br><br><br><b>Questions and
                        Answers</b><br><br>A. G. Chynoweth: Well that
                was 50 minutes of concentrated wisdom and observations
                accumulated over a fantastic career; I lost track of all
                the observations that were striking home. Some of them
                are very very timely. One was the plea for more computer
                capacity; I was hearing nothing but that this morning
                from several people, over and over again. So that was
                right on the mark today even though here we are 20 – 30
                years after when you were making similar remarks, Dick.
                I can think of all sorts of lessons that all of us can
                draw from your talk. And for one, as I walk around the
                halls in the future I hope I won't see as many closed
                doors in Bellcore. That was one observation I thought
                was very intriguing.<br><br>Thank you very, very much
                indeed Dick; that was a wonderful recollection. I'll now
                open it up for questions. I'm sure there are many people
                who would like to take up on some of the points that
                Dick was making.<br><br>Hamming: First let me respond to
                Alan Chynoweth about computing. I had computing in
                research and for 10 years I kept telling my management,
                "Get that !&@#% machine out of research. We are being
                forced to run problems all the time. We can't do
                research because were too busy operating and running the
                computing machines." Finally the message got through.
                They were going to move computing out of research to
                someplace else. I was persona non grata to say the least
                and I was surprised that people didn't kick my shins
                because everybody was having their toy taken away from
                them. I went in to Ed David's office and said, "Look
                Ed, you've got to give your researchers a machine. If
                you give them a great big machine, we'll be back in the
                same trouble we were before, so busy keeping it going we
                can't think. Give them the smallest machine you can
                because they are very able people. They will learn how
                to do things on a small machine instead of mass
                computing." As far as I'm concerned, that's how UNIX
                arose. We gave them a moderately small machine and they
                decided to make it do great things. They had to come up
                with a system to do it on. It is called UNIX!<br><br>A.
                G. Chynoweth: I just have to pick up on that one. In our
                present environment, Dick, while we wrestle with some of
                the red tape attributed to, or required by, the
                regulators, there is one quote that one exasperated AVP
                came up with and I've used it over and over again. He
                growled that, "UNIX was never a
                deliverable!"<br><br>Question: What about personal
                stress? Does that seem to make a
                difference?<br><br>Hamming: Yes, it does. If you don't
                get emotionally involved, it doesn't. I had incipient
                ulcers most of the years that I was at Bell Labs. I have
                since gone off to the Naval Postgraduate School and laid
                back somewhat, and now my health is much better. But if
                you want to be a great scientist you're going to have to
                put up with stress. You can lead a nice life; you can be
                a nice guy or you can be a great scientist. But nice
                guys end last, is what Leo Durocher said. If you want to
                lead a nice happy life with a lot of recreation and
                everything else, you'll lead a nice
                life.<br><br>Question: The remarks about having courage,
                no one could argue with; but those of us who have gray
                hairs or who are well established don't have to worry
                too much. But what I sense among the young people these
                days is a real concern over the risk taking in a highly
                competitive environment. Do you have any words of wisdom
                on this?<br><br>Hamming: I'll quote Ed David more. Ed
                David was concerned about the general loss of nerve in
                our society. It does seem to me that we've gone through
                various periods. Coming out of the war, coming out of
                Los Alamos where we built the bomb, coming out of
                building the radars and so on, there came into the
                mathematics department, and the research area, a group
                of people with a lot of guts. They've just seen things
                done; they've just won a war which was fantastic. We had
                reasons for having courage and therefore we did a great
                deal. I can't arrange that situation to do it again. I
                cannot blame the present generation for not having it,
                but I agree with what you say; I just cannot attach
                blame to it. It doesn't seem to me they have the desire
                for greatness; they lack the courage to do it. But we
                had, because we were in a favorable circumstance to have
                it; we just came through a tremendously successful war.
                In the war we were looking very, very bad for a long
                while; it was a very desperate struggle as you well
                know. And our success, I think, gave us courage and self
                confidence; that's why you see, beginning in the late
                forties through the fifties, a tremendous productivity
                at the labs which was stimulated from the earlier times.
                Because many of us were earlier forced to learn other
                things — we were forced to learn the things we didn't
                want to learn, we were forced to have an open door — and
                then we could exploit those things we learned. It is
                true, and I can't do anything about it; I cannot blame
                the present generation either. It's just a
                fact.<br><br>Question: Is there something management
                could or should do?<br><br>Hamming: Management can do
                very little. If you want to talk about managing
                research, that's a totally different talk. I'd take
                another hour doing that. This talk is about how the
                individual gets very successful research done in spite
                of anything the management does or in spite of any other
                opposition. And how do you do it? Just as I observe
                people doing it. It's just that simple and that
                hard!<br><br>Question: Is brainstorming a daily
                process?<br><br>Hamming: Once that was a very popular
                thing, but it seems not to have paid off. For myself I
                find it desirable to talk to other people; but a session
                of brainstorming is seldom worthwhile. I do go in to
                strictly talk to somebody and say, "Look, I think there
                has to be something here. Here's what I think I see ..."
                and then begin talking back and forth. But you want to
                pick capable people. To use another analogy, you know
                the idea called the 'critical mass.' If you have enough
                stuff you have critical mass. There is also the idea I
                used to call 'sound absorbers'. When you get too many
                sound absorbers, you give out an idea and they merely
                say, "Yes, yes, yes." What you want to do is get that
                critical mass in action; "Yes, that reminds me of so and
                so," or, "Have you thought about that or this?" When you
                talk to other people, you want to get rid of those sound
                absorbers who are nice people but merely say, "Oh yes,"
                and to find those who will stimulate you right
                back.<br><br>For example, you couldn't talk to John
                Pierce without being stimulated very quickly. There were
                a group of other people I used to talk with. For example
                there was Ed Gilbert; I used to go down to his office
                regularly and ask him questions and listen and come back
                stimulated. I picked my people carefully with whom I did
                or whom I didn't brainstorm because the sound absorbers
                are a curse. They are just nice guys; they fill the
                whole space and they contribute nothing except they
                absorb ideas and the new ideas just die away instead of
                echoing on. Yes, I find it necessary to talk to people.
                I think people with closed doors fail to do this so they
                fail to get their ideas sharpened, such as "Did you ever
                notice something over here?" I never knew anything about
                it — I can go over and look. Somebody points the way. On
                my visit here, I have already found several books that I
                must read when I get home. I talk to people and ask
                questions when I think they can answer me and give me
                clues that I do not know about. I go out and
                look!<br><br>Question: What kind of tradeoffs did you
                make in allocating your time for reading and writing and
                actually doing research?<br><br>Hamming: I believed, in
                my early days, that you should spend at least as much
                time in the polish and presentation as you did in the
                original research. Now at least 50% of the time must go
                for the presentation. It's a big, big
                number.<br><br>Question: How much effort should go into
                library work?<br><br>Hamming: It depends upon the field.
                I will say this about it. There was a fellow at Bell
                Labs, a very, very, smart guy. He was always in the
                library; he read everything. If you wanted references,
                you went to him and he gave you all kinds of references.
                But in the middle of forming these theories, I formed a
                proposition: there would be no effect named after him in
                the long run. He is now retired from Bell Labs and is an
                Adjunct Professor. He was very valuable; I'm not
                questioning that. He wrote some very good Physical
                Review articles; but there's no effect named after him
                because he read too much. If you read all the time what
                other people have done you will think the way they
                thought. If you want to think new thoughts that are
                different, then do what a lot of creative people do —
                get the problem reasonably clear and then refuse to look
                at any answers until you've thought the problem through
                carefully how you would do it, how you could slightly
                change the problem to be the correct one. So yes, you
                need to keep up. You need to keep up more to find out
                what the problems are than to read to find the
                solutions. The reading is necessary to know what is
                going on and what is possible. But reading to get the
                solutions does not seem to be the way to do great
                research. So I'll give you two answers. You read; but it
                is not the amount, it is the way you read that
                counts.<br><br>Question: How do you get your name
                attached to things?<br><br>Hamming: By doing great work.
                I'll tell you the hamming window one. I had given Tukey
                a hard time, quite a few times, and I got a phone call
                from him from Princeton to me at Murray Hill. I knew
                that he was writing up power spectra and he asked me if
                I would mind if he called a certain window a "hamming
                window." And I said to him, "Come on, John; you know
                perfectly well I did only a small part of the work but
                you also did a lot." He said, "Yes, Hamming, but you
                contributed a lot of small things; you're entitled to
                some credit." So he called it the hamming window. Now,
                let me go on. I had twitted John frequently about true
                greatness. I said true greatness is when your name is
                like ampere, watt, and fourier — when it's spelled with
                a lower case letter. That's how the hamming window came
                about.<br><br>Question: Dick, would you care to comment
                on the relative effectiveness between giving talks,
                writing papers, and writing books?<br><br>Hamming: In
                the short-haul, papers are very important if you want to
                stimulate someone tomorrow. If you want to get
                recognition long-haul, it seems to me writing books is
                more contribution because most of us need orientation.
                In this day of practically infinite knowledge, we need
                orientation to find our way. Let me tell you what
                infinite knowledge is. Since from the time of Newton to
                now, we have come close to doubling knowledge every 17
                years, more or less. And we cope with that, essentially,
                by specialization. In the next 340 years at that rate,
                there will be 20 doublings, i.e. a million, and there
                will be a million fields of specialty for every one
                field now. It isn't going to happen. The present growth
                of knowledge will choke itself off until we get
                different tools. I believe that books which try to
                digest, coordinate, get rid of the duplication, get rid
                of the less fruitful methods and present the underlying
                ideas clearly of what we know now, will be the things
                the future generations will value. Public talks are
                necessary; private talks are necessary; written papers
                are necessary. But I am inclined to believe that, in the
                long-haul, books which leave out what's not essential
                are more important than books which tell you everything
                because you don't want to know everything. I don't want
                to know that much about penguins is the usual reply. You
                just want to know the essence.<br><br>Question: You
                mentioned the problem of the Nobel Prize and the
                subsequent notoriety of what was done to some of the
                careers. Isn't that kind of a much more broad problem of
                fame? What can one do?<br><br>Hamming: Some things you
                could do are the following. Somewhere around every seven
                years make a significant, if not complete, shift in your
                field. Thus, I shifted from numerical analysis, to
                hardware, to software, and so on, periodically, because
                you tend to use up your ideas. When you go to a new
                field, you have to start over as a baby. You are no
                longer the big mukity muk and you can start back there
                and you can start planting those acorns which will
                become the giant oaks. Shannon, I believe, ruined
                himself. In fact when he left Bell Labs, I said, "That's
                the end of Shannon's scientific career." I received a
                lot of flak from my friends who said that Shannon was
                just as smart as ever. I said, "Yes, he'll be just as
                smart, but that's the end of his scientific career," and
                I truly believe it was.<br><br>You have to change. You
                get tired after a while; you use up your originality in
                one field. You need to get something nearby. I'm not
                saying that you shift from music to theoretical physics
                to English literature; I mean within your field you
                should shift areas so that you don't go stale. You
                couldn't get away with forcing a change every seven
                years, but if you could, I would require a condition for
                doing research, being that you will change your field of
                research every seven years with a reasonable definition
                of what it means, or at the end of 10 years, management
                has the right to compel you to change. I would insist on
                a change because I'm serious. What happens to the old
                fellows is that they get a technique going; they keep on
                using it. They were marching in that direction which was
                right then, but the world changes. There's the new
                direction; but the old fellows are still marching in
                their former direction.<br><br>You need to get into a
                new field to get new viewpoints, and before you use up
                all the old ones. You can do something about this, but
                it takes effort and energy. It takes courage to say,
                "Yes, I will give up my great reputation." For
                example, when error correcting codes were well launched,
                having these theories, I said, "Hamming, you are going
                to quit reading papers in the field; you are going to
                ignore it completely; you are going to try and do
                something else other than coast on that." I deliberately
                refused to go on in that field. I wouldn't even read
                papers to try to force myself to have a chance to do
                something else. I managed myself, which is what I'm
                preaching in this whole talk. Knowing many of my own
                faults, I manage myself. I have a lot of faults, so I've
                got a lot of problems, i.e. a lot of possibilities of
                management.<br><br>Question: Would you compare research
                and management?<br><br>Hamming: If you want to be a
                great researcher, you won't make it being president of
                the company. If you want to be president of the company,
                that's another thing. I'm not against being president of
                the company. I just don't want to be. I think Ian Ross
                does a good job as President of Bell Labs. I'm not
                against it; but you have to be clear on what you want.
                Furthermore, when you're young, you may have picked
                wanting to be a great scientist, but as you live longer,
                you may change your mind. For instance, I went to my
                boss, Bode, one day and said, "Why did you ever become
                department head? Why didn't you just be a good
                scientist?" He said, "Hamming, I had a vision of what
                mathematics should be in Bell Laboratories. And I saw if
                that vision was going to be realized, I had to make it
                happen; I had to be department head." When your vision
                of what you want to do is what you can do
                single-handedly, then you should pursue it. The day your
                vision, what you think needs to be done, is bigger than
                what you can do single-handedly, then you have to move
                toward management. And the bigger the vision is, the
                farther in management you have to go. If you have a
                vision of what the whole laboratory should be, or the
                whole Bell System, you have to get there to make it
                happen. You can't make it happen from the bottom very
                easily. It depends upon what goals and what desires you
                have. And as they change in life, you have to be
                prepared to change. I chose to avoid management because
                I preferred to do what I could do single-handedly. But
                that's the choice that I made, and it is biased. Each
                person is entitled to their choice. Keep an open mind.
                But when you do choose a path, for heaven's sake be
                aware of what you have done and the choice you have
                made. Don't try to do both sides.<br><br>Question: How
                important is one's own expectation or how important is
                it to be in a group or surrounded by people who expect
                great work from you?<br><br>Hamming: At Bell Labs
                everyone expected good work from me — it was a big help.
                Everybody expects you to do a good job, so you do, if
                you've got pride. I think it's very valuable to have
                first-class people around. I sought out the best people.
                The moment that physics table lost the best people, I
                left. The moment I saw that the same was true of the
                chemistry table, I left. I tried to go with people who
                had great ability so I could learn from them and who
                would expect great results out of me. By deliberately
                managing myself, I think I did much better than laissez
                faire.<br><br>Question: You, at the outset of your talk,
                minimized or played down luck; but you seemed also to
                gloss over the circumstances that got you to Los Alamos,
                that got you to Chicago, that got you to Bell
                Laboratories.<br><br>Hamming: There was some luck. On
                the other hand I don't know the alternate branches.
                Until you can say that the other branches would not have
                been equally or more successful, I can't say. Is it luck
                the particular thing you do? For example, when I met
                Feynman at Los Alamos, I knew he was going to get a
                Nobel Prize. I didn't know what for. But I knew darn
                well he was going to do great work. No matter what
                directions came up in the future, this man would do
                great work. And sure enough, he did do great work. It
                isn't that you only do a little great work at this
                circumstance and that was luck, there are many
                opportunities sooner or later. There are a whole pail
                full of opportunities, of which, if you're in this
                situation, you seize one and you're great over there
                instead of over here. There is an element of luck, yes
                and no. Luck favors a prepared mind; luck favors a
                prepared person. It is not guaranteed; I don't guarantee
                success as being absolutely certain. I'd say luck
                changes the odds, but there is some definite control on
                the part of the individual.<br><br>Go forth, then, and
                do great work!<br><br>
