        <i>“The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands at
                the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer
                marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed.”</i>

                How strange is the lot of us mortals! Each of us is here for a brief sojourn; for what purpose he knows
                not, though he sometimes thinks he senses it. But without deeper reflection one knows from daily life
                that one exists for other people — first of all for those upon whose smiles and well-being our own
                happiness is wholly dependent, and then for the many, unknown to us, to whose destinies we are bound by
                the ties of sympathy. A hundred times every day I remind myself that my inner and outer life are based
                on the labors of other men, living and dead, and that I must exert myself in order to give in the same
                measure as I have received and am still receiving. I am strongly drawn to a frugal life and am often
                oppressively aware that I am engrossing an undue amount of the labor of my fellow-men. I regard class
                distinctions as unjustified and, in the last resort, based on force. I also believe that a simple and
                unassuming life is good for everybody, physically and mentally.

                I do not at all believe in human freedom in the philosophical sense. Everybody acts not only under
                external compulsion but also in accordance with inner necessity. Schopenhauer’s saying, “A man can do
                what he wants, but not want what he wants,” has been a very real inspiration to me since my youth; it
                has been a continual consolation in the face of life’s hardships, my own and others’, and an unfailing
                well-spring of tolerance. This realization mercifully mitigates the easily paralyzing sense of
                responsibility and prevents us from taking ourselves and other people all too seriously; it is conducive
                to a view of life which, in particular, gives humor its due.

                To inquire after the meaning or object of one’s own existence or that of all creatures has always seemed
                to me absurd from an objective point of view. And yet everybody has certain ideals which determine the
                direction of his endeavors and his judgments. In this sense I have never looked upon ease and happiness
                as ends in themselves — this ethical basis I call the ideal of a pigsty. The ideals which have lighted
                my way, and time after time have given me new courage to face life cheerfully, have been Kindness,
                Beauty, and Truth. Without the sense of kinship with men of like mind, without the occupation with the
                objective world, the eternally unattainable in the field of art and scientific endeavors, life would
                have seemed to me empty. The trite objects of human efforts — possessions, outward success, luxury —
                have always seemed to me contemptible.

                My passionate sense of social justice and social responsibility has always contrasted oddly with my
                pronounced lack of need for direct contact with other human beings and human communities. I am truly a
                “lone traveler” and have never belonged to my country, my home, my friends, or even my immediate family,
                with my whole heart; in the face of all these ties, I have never lost a sense of distance and a need for
                solitude — feelings which increase with the years. One becomes sharply aware, but without regret, of the
                limits of mutual understanding and consonance with other people. No doubt, such a person loses some of
                his innocence and unconcern; on the other hand, he is largely independent of the opinions, habits, and
                judgments of his fellows and avoids the temptation to build his inner equilibrium upon such insecure
                foundations.

                My political ideal is democracy. Let every man be respected as an individual and no man idolized. It is
                an irony of fate that I myself have been the recipient of excessive admiration and reverence from my
                fellow-beings, through no fault, and no merit, of my own. The cause of this may well be the desire,
                unattainable for many, to understand the few ideas to which I have with my feeble powers attained
                through ceaseless struggle. I am quite aware that it is necessary for the achievement of the objective
                of an organization that one man should do the thinking and directing and generally bear the
                responsibility. But the led must not be coerced, they must be able to choose their leader. An autocratic
                system of coercion, in my opinion, soon degenerates. For force always attracts men of low morality, and
                I believe it to be an invariable rule that tyrants of genius are succeeded by scoundrels. For this
                reason I have always been passionately opposed to systems such as we see in Italy and Russia today. The
                thing that has brought discredit upon the form of democracy as it exists in Europe today is not to be
                laid to the door of the democratic principle as such, but to the lack of stability of governments and to
                the impersonal character of the electoral system. I believe that in this respect the United States of
                America have found the right way. They have a President who is elected for a sufficiently long period
                and has sufficient powers really to exercise his responsibility. What I value, on the other hand, in the
                German political system is the more extensive provision that it makes for the individual in case of
                illness or need. The really valuable thing in the pageant of human life seems to me not the political
                state, but the creative, sentient individual, the personality; it alone creates the noble and the
                sublime, while the herd as such remains dull in thought and dull in feeling.

                This topic brings me to that worst outcrop of herd life, the military system, which I abhor. That a man
                can take pleasure in marching in fours to the strains of a band is enough to make me despise him. He has
                only been given his big brain by mistake; unprotected spinal marrow was all he needed. This plague-spot
                of civilization ought to be abolished with all possible speed. Heroism on command, senseless violence,
                and all the loathsome nonsense that goes by the name of patriotism — how passionately I hate them! How
                vile and despicable seems war to me! I would rather be hacked in pieces than take part in such an
                abominable business. My opinion of the human race is high enough that I believe this bogey would have
                disappeared long ago, had the sound sense of the peoples not been systematically corrupted by commercial
                and political interests acting through the schools and the Press.

                The most beautiful experience we can have is the mysterious. It is the fundamental emotion which stands
                at the cradle of true art and true science. Whoever does not know it and can no longer wonder, no longer
                marvel, is as good as dead, and his eyes are dimmed. It was the experience of mystery — even if mixed
                with fear — that engendered religion. A knowledge of the existence of something we cannot penetrate, our
                perceptions of the profoundest reason and the most radiant beauty, which only in their most primitive
                forms are accessible to our minds — it is this knowledge and this emotion that constitute true
                religiosity; in this sense, and in this alone, I am a deeply religious man. I cannot conceive of a God
                who rewards and punishes his creatures, or has a will of the kind that we experience in ourselves.
                Neither can I nor would I want to conceive of an individual that survives his physical death; let feeble
                souls, from fear or absurd egoism, cherish such thoughts. I am satisfied with the mystery of the
                eternity of life and with the awareness and a glimpse of the marvelous structure of the existing world,
                together with the devoted striving to comprehend a portion, be it ever so tiny, of the Reason that
                manifests itself in nature.
