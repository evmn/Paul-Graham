        <h1>The Decline and Fall of Work</h1>
        <p class="author">by <b>Raoul Vaneigem</b> in 1967</p>
        <p><i>The duty to produce alienates the passion for creation. Productive labour is part and parcel of the
                        technology of law and order. The working day grows shorter as the empire of conditioning
                        extends.</i></p>
        <p>
                In an industrial society which confuses work and productivity, the necessity of producing has always
                been an enemy of the desire to create. What spark of humanity, of a possible creativity, can remain
                alive in a being dragged out of sleep at six every morning, jolted about in suburban trains, deafened by
                the racket of machinery, bleached and steamed by meaningless sounds and gestures, spun dry by
                statistical controls, and tossed out at the end of the day into the entrance halls of railway stations,
                those cathedrals of departure for the hell of weekdays and the nugatory paradise of weekends, where the
                crowd communes in weariness and boredom? From adolescence to retirement each 24-hour cycle repeats the
                same shattering bombardment, like bullets hitting a window: mechanical repetition, time-which-is-money,
                submission to bosses, boredom, exhaustion. From the butchering of youth’s energy to the gaping wound of
                old age, life cracks in every direction under the blows of forced labour. Never before has a
                civilization reached such a degree of contempt for life; never before has a generation, drowned in
                mortification, felt such a rage to live. The same people who are murdered slowly in the mechanized
                slaughterhouses of work are also arguing, singing, drinking, dancing, making love, holding the streets,
                picking up weapons and inventing a new poetry. Already the front against forced labour is being formed;
                its gestures of refusal are moulding the consciousness of the future. Every call for productivity in the
                conditions chosen by capitalist and Soviet economy is a call to slavery.

                The necessity of production is so easily proved that any hack philosopher of industrialism can fill ten
                books with it. Unfortunately for these neo-economist thinkers, these proofs belong to the nineteenth
                century, a time when the misery of the working classes made the right to work the counterpart of the
                right to be a slave, claimed at the dawn of time by prisoners about to be massacred. Above all it was a
                question of surviving, of not disappearing physically. The imperatives of production are the imperatives
                of survival; from now on, people want to live, not just to survive.

                The tripalium is an instrument of torture. Labor means ’suffering’. We are unwise to forget the origin
                of the words ’travail’ and ’labour’. At least the nobility never forgot their own dignity and the
                indignity which marked their bondsmen. The aristocratic contempt for work reflected the master’s
                contempt for the dominated classes; work was the expiation to which they were condemned to all eternity
                by the divine decree which had willed them, for impenetrable reasons, to be inferior. Work took its
                place among the sanctions of Providence as the punishment for poverty, and because it was the means to a
                future salvation such a punishment could take on the attributes of pleasure. basically, work was less
                important than submission.
        </p>

                The bourgeoisie does not dominate, it exploits. It does not need to be master, it prefers to use. Why
                has nobody seen that the principle of productivity simply replaced the principle of feudal authority?
                Why has nobody wanted to understand?
        </p>
        <p>
                Is it because work ameliorates the human condition and saves the poor, at least in illusion, from
                eternal damnation? Undoubtedly, but today it seems that the carrot of happier tomorrows has smoothly
                replaced the carrot of salvation in the next world. In both cases the present is always under the heel
                of oppression.
        </p>
        <p>
                Is it because it transforms nature? Yes, but what can I do with a nature ordered in terms of profit and
                loss, in a world where the inflation of techniques conceals the deflation of the use-value of life?
                Besides, just as the sexual act is not intended to procreate, but makes children by accident, organized
                labour transforms the surface of continents as a by-product, not a purpose. Work to transform the world?
                Tell me another. The world is being transformed in the direction prescribed by the existence of forced
                labour; which is why it is being transformed so badly.
        </p>

                Perhaps man realizes himself in his forced labour? In the nineteenth century the concept of work
                retained a vestige of the notion of creativity. Zola describes a nailsmiths’ contest in which the
                workers competed in the perfection of their tiny masterpiece. Love of the trade and the vitality of an
                already smothered creativity incontestably helped man to bear ten or fifteen hours which nobody could
                have stood if some kind of pleasure had not slipped into it. The survival of the craft conception
                allowed each worker to contrive a precarious comfort in the hell of the factory. But Taylorism dealt the
                death-blow to a mentality which had been carefully fostered by archaic capitalism. It is useless to
                expect even a caricature of creativity from the conveyor-belt. Nowadays ambition and the love of the job
                well done are the indelible mark of defeat and the most mindless submission. Which is why, wherever
                submission is demanded, the old ideological fart wends its way, from the Arbeit Macht Frei of the
                concentration camps to the homilies of Henry Ford and Mao Tse-tung.
        </p>
        <p>
                So what is the function of forced labour? The myth of power exercised jointly by the master and God drew
                its coercive force from the unity of the feudal system. Destroying the unitary myth, the power of the
                bourgeoisie inaugurated, under the flag of crisis, the reign of ideologies, which can never attain,
                separately or together, a fraction of the efficacy of myth. The dictatorship of productive work stepped
                into the breech. It’s mission is physically to weaken the majority of men, collectively to castrate and
                stupefy them in order to make them receptive to the least pregnant, least virile, most senile ideologies
                in the entire history of falsehood.
        </p>

                Most of the proletariat at the beginning of the nineteenth century had been physically enervated,
                systematically broken by the torture of the workshop. Revolts came from artisans, from privileged or
                unemployed groups, not from workers shattered by fifteen hours of labour. Isn’t it disturbing that the
                reduction of working time came just when the spectacular ideological miscellany produced by consumer
                society was beginning effectively to replace the feudal myths destroyed by the young bourgeoisie?
                (People really have worked for a refrigerator, a car, a television set. Many still do, ’invited’ as they
                are to consume the passivity and empty time that the ’necessity’ of production ’offers’ them.)
        </p>
        <p>
                Statistics published in 1938 indicated that the use of the most modern technology then available would
                reduce necessary working time to three hours a day. Not only are we a long way off with our seven hours,
                but after wearing out generations of workers by promising them the happiness which is sold today on the
                installment plan, the bourgeoisie (and its Soviet equivalent) pursue man’s destruction outside the
                workshop. Tomorrow they will deck out their five hours of necessary wear and tear with a time of
                ’creativity’ which will grow just as fast as they can fill it with the impossibility of creating
                anything (the famous ’leisure explosion’).

                It has been quite correctly written: &quotChina faces gigantic economic problems; for her, productivity
                is a matter of life and death." Nobody would dream of denying it. What seems important to me is not the
                economic imperatives, but the manner of responding to them. The Red Army in 1917 was a new kind of
                organization. The Red Army in 1960 is an army such as is found in capitalist countries. Circumstances
                have shown that its effectiveness has been far below the potential of a revolutionary militia. In the
                same way, the planned Chinese economy, by refusing to allow federated groups to organize their work
                autonomously, condemns itself to become another example of the perfected form of capitalism called
                socialism. Has anyone bothered to study the modes of work of primitive peoples, the importance of play
                and creativity, the incredible yield obtained by methods which the application of modern technology
                would make a hundred times more efficient? Obviously not. Every appeal for productivity comes from
                above. But only creativity is spontaneously rich. It is not from ’productivity’ that a full life is to
                be expected, it is not ’productivity’ that will produce an enthusiastic collective response to economic
                needs. But what can we say when we know how the cult of work is honoured from Cuba to China, and how
                well the virtuous pages of Guizot would sound in a May Day speech?
        </p>
        <p>
                To the extent that automation and cybernetics foreshadow the massive replacement of workers by
                mechanical slaves, forced labour is revealed as belonging purely to the barbaric practices needed to
                maintain order. Thus power manufactures the dose of fatigue necessary for the passive assimilation of
                its televised diktats. What carrot is worth working for, after this? The game is up; there is nothing to
                lose anymore, not even an illusion. The organization of work and the organization of leisure are the
                blades of the castrating shears whose job is to improve the race of fawning dogs. One day, will we see
                strikers, demanding automation and a ten-hour week, choosing, instead of picketing, to make love in the
                factories, the offices and the culture centres? Only the planners, the managers, the union bosses and
                the sociologists would be surprised and worried. Not without reason; after all, their skin is at stake.
