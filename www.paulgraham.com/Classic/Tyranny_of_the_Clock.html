                In no characteristic is existing society in the West so sharply distinguished from the earlier
                societies, whether of Europe or the East, than in its conception of time. To the ancient Chinese or
                Greek, to the Arab herdsman or Mexican peon of today, time is represented in the cyclic processes of
                nature, the alternation of day and night, the passage from season to season. The nomads and farmers
                measured and still measure their day from sunrise to sunset, and their year in terms of the seedtime and
                harvest, of the falling leaf and the ice thawing on the lakes and rivers. The farmer worked according to
                the elements, the craftsman for so long as he felt it necessary to perfect his product. Time was seen in
                a process of natural change, and men were not concerned in its exact measurement. For this reason
                civilisations highly developed in other respects had the most primitive means of measuring time, the
                hour glass with it's trickling sand or dripping water, the sundial, useless on a dull day, and the
                candle or lamp whose unburnt remnant of oil or wax indicated the hours. All these devices where
                approximate and inexact, and were often rendered unreliable by the weather or the personal laziness of
                the tender. Nowhere in the ancient or medieval world were more than a tiny minority of men concerned
                with time in the terms of mathematical exactitude.

                Modern, Western man, however lives in a world which runs according to the mechanical and mathematical
                symbols of clock time. The clock dictates his movements and inhibits his actions. The clock turns time
                from a process of nature into a commodity that can be measured and bought and sold like soap or
                sultanas. And because, without some means of exact time keeping, industrial capitalism could never have
                developed and could not continue to exploit the workers, the clock represents an element of mechanical
                tyranny in the lives of modern men more potent than any individual exploiter or any other machine. It is
                valuable to trace the historical process by which the clock influenced the social development of modern
                European civilisation.

                It is a frequent circumstance of history that a culture or civilisation develops the device which will
                later be used for its destruction. The ancient Chinese, for example, invented gunpowder, which was
                developed by the military experts of the West and eventually led to the Chinese civilisation itself
                being destroyed by the high explosives of modern warfare. Similarly, the supreme achievement of the
                ingenuity of the craftsmen in the medieval cities of Europe was the invention of the mechanical clock,
                which, with it's revolutionary alteration of the concept of time, materially assisted the growth of
                exploiting capitalism and the destruction of medieval culture.
        </p>

                There is a tradition that the clock appeared in the eleventh century, as a device for ringing bells at
                regular intervals in the monasteries which, with the regimented life they imposed on their inmates, were
                the closest social approximation in the middle ages to the factory of today. The first authenticated
                clock, however, appeared in the thirteenth century, and it was not until the fourteenth century that
                clocks became common ornaments of the public buildings in the German cities.
        </p>
        <p>
                These early clocks, operated by weights, were not particularly accurate, and it was not until the
                sixteenth century that any great reliability was obtained. In England, for instance the clock at Hampton
                Court, made in 1540, is said to have been the first accurate clock in the country. And even the accuracy
                of the sixteenth century clocks are relative, for they were only equipped with hour hands. The idea of
                measuring time in minutes and seconds had been thought out by the early mathematicians as far back as
                the fourteenth century, but it was not until the invention of the pendulum in 1657 that sufficient
                accuracy was attained to permit the addition of a minute hand, and the second hand did not appear until
                the eighteenth century. These two centuries, it should be observed, were those in which capitalism grew
                to such an extent that it was able to take advantage of the industrial revolution in technique in order
                to establish its domination over society.
        </p>
        <p>
                The clock, as Lewis Mumford has pointed out, represents the key machine of the machine age, both for its
                influence on technology and its influence on the habits of men. Technically, the clock was the first
                really automatic machine that attained any importance in the life of men. Previous to its invention, the
                common machines were of such a nature that their operation depended on some external and unreliable
                force, such as human or animal muscles, water or wind. It is true that the Greeks had invented a number
                of primitive automatic machines, but these where used, like Hero's steam engine, for obtaining
                'supernatural' effects in the temples or for amusing the tyrants of Levantine cities. But the clock was
                the first automatic machine that attained a public importance and a social function. Clock-making became
                the industry from which men learnt the elements of machine making and gained the technical skill that
                was to produce the complicated machinery of the industrial revolution.
        </p>
        <p>
                Socially the clock had a more radical influence than any other machine, in that it was the means by
                which the regularisation and regimentation of life necessary for an exploiting system of industry could
                best be attained. The clock provided the means by which time - a category so elusive that no philosophy
                has yet determined its nature - could be measured concretely in more tangible forms of space provided by
                the circumference of a clock dial. Time as duration became disregarded, and men began to talk and think
                always of 'lengths' of time, just as if they were talking of lengths of calico. And time, being now
                measurable in mathematical symbols, became regarded as a commodity that could be bought and sold in the
                same way as any other commodity.
        </p>
        <p>
                The new capitalists, in particular, became rabidly time-conscious. Time, here symbolising the labour of
                workers, was regarded by them almost as if it were the chief raw material of industry. 'Time is money'
                became on of the key slogans of capitalist ideology, and the timekeeper was the most significant of the
                new types of official introduced by the capitalist dispensation.
        </p>
        <p>
                in the early factories the employers went so far as to manipulate their clocks or sound their factory
                whistles at the wrong times in order to defraud their workers a little of this valuable new commodity.
                Later such practices became less frequent, but the influence of the clock imposed a regularity on the
                lives of the majority of men which had previously been known only in the monastery. Men actually became
                like clocks, acting with a repetitive regularity which had no resemblance to the rhythmic life of a
                natural being. They became, as the Victorian phrase put it, 'as regular as clockwork'. Only in the
                country districts where the natural lives of animals and plants and the elements still dominated life,
                did any large proportion of the population fail to succumb to the deadly tick of monotony.
        </p>
        <p>
                At first this new attitude to time, this new regularity of life, was imposed by the clock-owning masters
                on the unwilling poor. The factory slave reacted in his spare time by living with a chaotic irregularity
                which characterised the gin-sodden slums of early nineteenth century industrialism. Men fled to the
                timeless world of drink or Methodist inspiration. But gradually the idea of regularity spread downwards
                among the workers. Nineteenth century religion and morality played their part by proclaiming the sin of
                'wasting time'. The introduction of mass-produced watches and clocks in the 1850's spread
                time-consciousness among those who had previously merely reacted to the stimulus of the knocker-up or
                the factory whistle. In the church and in the school, in the office and the workshop, punctuality was
                held up as the greatest of the virtues.
        </p>
        <p>
                Out of this slavish dependence on mechanical time which spread insidiously into every class in the
                nineteenth century there grew up the demoralising regimentation of life which characterises factory work
                today. The man who fails to conform faces social disapproval and economic ruin. If he is late at the
                factory the worker will lose his job or even, at the present day [1944 - while wartime regulations were
                in force], find himself in prison. Hurried meals, the regular morning and evening scramble for trains or
                buses, the strain of having to work to time schedules, all contribute to digestive and nervous
                disorders, to ruin health and shorten life.
        </p>
        <p>
                Nor does the financial imposition of regularity tend, in the long run, to greater efficiency. Indeed,
                the quality of the product is usually much poorer, because the employer, regarding time as a commodity
                which he has to pay for, forces the operative to maintain such a speed that his work must necessarily be
                skimped. Quantity rather than quality becomes the criterion, the enjoyment is taken out of work itself,
                and the worker in his turn becomes a 'clock-watcher', concerned only when he will be able to escape to
                the scanty and monotonous leisure of industrial society, in which he 'kills time' by cramming in as much
                time-scheduled and mechanised enjoyment of cinema, radio and newspapers as his wage packet and his
                tiredness allow. Only if he is willing to accept of the hazards of living by his faith or his wits can
                the man without money avoid living as a slave to the clock.
        </p>
        <p>
                The problem of the clock is, in general, similar to that of the machine. Mechanical time is valuable as
                a means of co-ordination of activities in a highly developed society, just as the machine is valuable as
                a means of reducing unnecessary labour to the minimum. Both are valuable for the contribution they make
                to the smooth running of society, and should be used insofar as they assist men to co-operate
                efficiently and to eliminate monotonous toil and social confusion. But neither should be allowed to
                dominate mens lives as they do today.
        </p>
        <p>
                Now the movement of the clock sets the tempo men's lives - they become the servant of the concept of
                time which they themselves have made, and are held in fear, like Frankenstein by his own monster. In a
                sane and free society such an arbitrary domination of man's functions by either clock or machine would
                obviously be out of the question. The domination of man by the creation of man is even more ridiculous
                than the domination of man by man. Mechanical time would be relegated to its true function of a means of
                reference and co-ordination, and men would return again to a balance view of life no longer dominated by
                the worship of the clock. Complete liberty implies freedom from the tyranny of abstractions as well as
                from the rule of men.
