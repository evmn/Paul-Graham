        <h1>The Sporting Spirit</h1>

                Now that the brief visit of the Dynamo football team has come to an end, it is possible to say publicly
                what many thinking people were saying privately before the Dynamos ever arrived. That is, that sport is
                an unfailing cause of ill-will, and that if such a visit as this had any effect at all on Anglo-Soviet
                relations, it could only be to make them slightly worse than before.
        </p>
        <p>
                Even the newspapers have been unable to conceal the fact that at least two of the four matches played
                led to much bad feeling. At the Arsenal match, I am told by someone who was there, a British and a
                Russian player came to blows and the crowd booed the referee. The Glasgow match, someone else informs
                me, was simply a free-for-all from the start. And then there was the controversy, typical of our
                nationalistic age, about the composition of the Arsenal team. Was it really an all-England team, as
                claimed by the Russians, or merely a league team, as claimed by the British? And did the Dynamos end
                their tour abruptly in order to avoid playing an all-England team? As usual, everyone answers these
                questions according to his political predilections. Not quite everyone, however. I noted with interest,
                as an instance of the vicious passions that football provokes, that the sporting correspondent of the
                russophile News Chronicle took the anti-Russian line and maintained that Arsenal was not an all-England
                team. No doubt the controversy will continue to echo for years in the footnotes of history books.
                Meanwhile the result of the Dynamos’ tour, in so far as it has had any result, will have been to create
                fresh animosity on both sides.
        </p>
        <p>
                And how could it be otherwise? I am always amazed when I hear people saying that sport creates goodwill
                between the nations, and that if only the common peoples of the world could meet one another at football
                or cricket, they would have no inclination to meet on the battlefield. Even if one didn’t know from
                concrete examples (the 1936 Olympic Games, for instance) that international sporting contests lead to
                orgies of hatred, one could deduce it from general principles.
        </p>

                Nearly all the sports practised nowadays are competitive. You play to win, and the game has little
                meaning unless you do your utmost to win. On the village green, where you pick up sides and no feeling
                of local patriotism is involved, it is possible to play simply for the fun and exercise: but as soon as
                the question of prestige arises, as soon as you feel that you and some larger unit will be disgraced if
                you lose, the most savage combative instincts are aroused. Anyone who has played even in a school
                football match knows this. At the international level sport is frankly mimic warfare. But the
                significant thing is not the behaviour of the players but the attitude of the spectators: and, behind
                the spectators, of the nations who work themselves into furies over these absurd contests, and seriously
                believe – at any rate for short periods – that running, jumping and kicking a ball are tests of national
                virtue.
        </p>
        <p>
                Even a leisurely game like cricket, demanding grace rather than strength, can cause much ill-will, as we
                saw in the controversy over body-line bowling and over the rough tactics of the Australian team that
                visited England in 1921. Football, a game in which everyone gets hurt and every nation has its own style
                of play which seems unfair to foreigners, is far worse. Worst of all is boxing. One of the most horrible
                sights in the world is a fight between white and coloured boxers before a mixed audience. But a boxing
                audience is always disgusting, and the behaviour of the women, in particular, is such that the army, I
                believe, does not allow them to attend its contests. At any rate, two or three years ago, when Home
                Guards and regular troops were holding a boxing tournament, I was placed on guard at the door of the
                hall, with orders to keep the women out.
        </p>
        <p>
                In England, the obsession with sport is bad enough, but even fiercer passions are aroused in young
                countries where games playing and nationalism are both recent developments. In countries like India or
                Burma, it is necessary at football matches to have strong cordons of police to keep the crowd from
                invading the field. In Burma, I have seen the supporters of one side break through the police and
                disable the goalkeeper of the opposing side at a critical moment. The first big football match that was
                played in Spain about fifteen years ago led to an uncontrollable riot. As soon as strong feelings of
                rivalry are aroused, the notion of playing the game according to the rules always vanishes. People want
                to see one side on top and the other side humiliated, and they forget that victory gained through
                cheating or through the intervention of the crowd is meaningless. Even when the spectators don’t
                intervene physically they try to influence the game by cheering their own side and ‘rattling’ opposing
                players with boos and insults. Serious sport has nothing to do with fair play. It is bound up with
                hatred, jealousy, boastfulness, disregard of all rules and sadistic pleasure in witnessing violence: in
                other words it is war minus the shooting.
        </p>
        <p>
                Instead of blah-blahing about the clean, healthy rivalry of the football field and the great part played
                by the Olympic Games in bringing the nations together, it is more useful to inquire how and why this
                modern cult of sport arose. Most of the games we now play are of ancient origin, but sport does not seem
                to have been taken very seriously between Roman times and the nineteenth century. Even in the English
                public schools the games cult did not start till the later part of the last century. Dr Arnold,
                generally regarded as the founder of the modern public school, looked on games as simply a waste of
                time. Then, chiefly in England and the United States, games were built up into a heavily-financed
                activity, capable of attracting vast crowds and rousing savage passions, and the infection spread from
                country to country. It is the most violently combative sports, football and boxing, that have spread the
                widest. There cannot be much doubt that the whole thing is bound up with the rise of nationalism – that
                is, with the lunatic modern habit of identifying oneself with large power units and seeing everything in
                terms of competitive prestige. Also, organised games are more likely to flourish in urban communities
                where the average human being lives a sedentary or at least a confined life, and does not get much
                opportunity for creative labour. In a rustic community a boy or young man works off a good deal of his
                surplus energy by walking, swimming, snowballing, climbing trees, riding horses, and by various sports
                involving cruelty to animals, such as fishing, cock-fighting and ferreting for rats. In a big town one
                must indulge in group activities if one wants an outlet for one’s physical strength or for one’s
                sadistic impulses. Games are taken seriously in London and New York, and they were taken seriously in
                Rome and Byzantium: in the Middle Ages they were played, and probably played with much physical
                brutality, but they were not mixed up with politics nor a cause of group hatreds.
        </p>

                If you wanted to add to the vast fund of ill-will existing in the world at this moment, you could hardly
                do it better than by a series of football matches between Jews and Arabs, Germans and Czechs, Indians
                and British, Russians and Poles, and Italians and Jugoslavs, each match to be watched by a mixed
                audience of 100,000 spectators. I do not, of course, suggest that sport is one of the main causes of
                international rivalry; big-scale sport is itself, I think, merely another effect of the causes that have
                produced nationalism. Still, you do make things worse by sending forth a team of eleven men, labelled as
                national champions, to do battle against some rival team, and allowing it to be felt on all sides that
                whichever nation is defeated will ‘lose face’.
        </p>
        <p>
                I hope, therefore, that we shan’t follow up the visit of the Dynamos by sending a British team to the
                USSR. If we must do so, then let us send a second-rate team which is sure to be beaten and cannot be
                claimed to represent Britain as a whole. There are quite enough real causes of trouble already, and we
                need not add to them by encouraging young men to kick each other on the shins amid the roars of
                infuriated spectators.
