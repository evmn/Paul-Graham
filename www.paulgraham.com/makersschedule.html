                July 2009<br><br>One reason programmers dislike
                meetings so much is that they're on
                a different type of schedule from other people.
                Meetings cost them
                more.<br><br>There are two types of schedule,
                which I'll call the manager's
                schedule and the maker's schedule. The manager's
                schedule is for
                bosses. It's embodied in the traditional
                appointment book, with
                each day cut into one hour intervals. You can
                block off several
                hours for a single task if you need to, but by
                default you change
                what you're doing every hour.<br><br>When you
                use time that way, it's merely a practical
                problem to meet
                with someone. Find an open slot in your
                schedule, book them, and
                you're done.<br><br>Most powerful people are on
                the manager's schedule. It's the
                schedule of command. But there's another way of
                using time that's
                common among people who make things, like
                programmers and writers.
                They generally prefer to use time in units of
                half a day at least.
                You can't write or program well in units of an
                hour. That's barely
                enough time to get started.<br><br>When you're
                operating on the maker's schedule, meetings are
                a
                disaster. A single meeting can blow a whole
                afternoon, by breaking
                it into two pieces each too small to do anything
                hard in. Plus you
                have to remember to go to the meeting. That's no
                problem for someone
                on the manager's schedule. There's always
                something coming on the
                next hour; the only question is what. But when
                someone on the
                maker's schedule has a meeting, they have to
                think about it.<br><br>For someone on the
                maker's schedule, having a meeting is like
                throwing an exception. It doesn't merely cause
                you to switch from
                one task to another; it changes the mode in
                which you work.<br><br>I find one meeting can
                sometimes affect a whole day. A meeting
                commonly blows at least half a day, by breaking
                up a morning or
                afternoon. But in addition there's sometimes a
                cascading effect.
                If I know the afternoon is going to be broken
                up, I'm slightly less
                likely to start something ambitious in the
                morning. I know this
                may sound oversensitive, but if you're a maker,
                think of your own
                case. Don't your spirits rise at the thought of
                having an entire
                day free to work, with no appointments at all?
                Well, that means
                your spirits are correspondingly depressed when
                you don't. And
                ambitious projects are by definition close to
                the limits of your
                capacity. A small decrease in morale is enough
                to kill them off.<br><br>Each type of schedule
                works fine by itself. Problems arise when
                they meet. Since most powerful people operate on
                the manager's
                schedule, they're in a position to make everyone
                resonate at their
                frequency if they want to. But the smarter ones
                restrain themselves,
                if they know that some of the people working for
                them need long
                chunks of time to work in.<br><br>Our case is an
                unusual one. Nearly all investors, including all
                VCs I know, operate on the manager's schedule.
                But
                <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y
                        Combinator</a>
                runs on the maker's schedule. Rtm and Trevor and
                I do because we
                always have, and Jessica does too, mostly,
                because she's gotten
                into sync with us.<br><br>I wouldn't be
                surprised if there start to be more companies
                like
                us. I suspect founders may increasingly be able
                to resist, or at
                least postpone, turning into managers, just as a
                few decades ago
                they started to be able to resist switching from
                jeans
                to suits.<br><br>How do we manage to advise so
                many startups on the maker's schedule?
                By using the classic device for simulating the
                manager's schedule
                within the maker's: office hours. Several times
                a week I set aside
                a chunk of time to meet founders we've funded.
                These chunks of
                time are at the end of my working day, and I
                wrote a signup program
                that ensures all the appointments within a given
                set of office hours
                are clustered at the end. Because they come at
                the end of my day
                these meetings are never an interruption.
                (Unless their working
                day ends at the same time as mine, the meeting
                presumably interrupts
                theirs, but since they made the appointment it
                must be worth it to
                them.) During busy periods, office hours
                sometimes get long enough
                that they compress the day, but they never
                interrupt it.<br><br>
                When we were working on <a href="start.html">
                        <font color="#000099">our own startup
                        </font>
                </a>, back in the 90s, I evolved
                another trick for partitioning the day. I used
                to program from
                dinner till about 3 am every day, because at
                night no one could
                interrupt me. Then I'd sleep till about 11 am,
                and come in and
                work until dinner on what I called "business
                stuff." I never thought
                of it in these terms, but in effect I had two
                workdays each day,
                one on the manager's schedule and one on the
                maker's.<br><br>When you're operating on the
                manager's schedule you can do something
                you'd never want to do on the maker's: you can
                have speculative
                meetings. You can meet someone just to get to
                know one another.
                If you have an empty slot in your schedule, why
                not? Maybe it will
                turn out you can help one another in some
                way.<br><br>Business people in Silicon Valley
                (and the whole world, for that
                matter) have speculative meetings all the time.
                They're effectively
                free if you're on the manager's schedule.
                They're so common that
                there's distinctive language for proposing them:
                saying that you
                want to "grab coffee," for
                example.<br><br>Speculative meetings are
                terribly costly if you're on the maker's
                schedule, though. Which puts us in something of
                a bind. Everyone
                assumes that, like other investors, we run on
                the manager's schedule.
                So they introduce us to someone they think we
                ought to meet, or
                send us an email proposing we grab coffee. At
                this point we have
                two options, neither of them good: we can meet
                with them, and lose
                half a day's work; or we can try to avoid
                meeting them, and probably
                offend them.<br><br>Till recently we weren't
                clear in our own minds about the source
                of the problem. We just took it for granted that
                we had to either
                blow our schedules or offend people. But now
                that I've realized
                what's going on, perhaps there's a third option:
                to write something
                explaining the two types of schedule. Maybe
                eventually, if the
                conflict between the manager's schedule and the
                maker's schedule
                starts to be more widely understood, it will
                become less of a
                problem.<br><br>Those of us on the maker's
                schedule are willing to compromise. We
                know we have to have some number of meetings.
                All we ask from those
                on the manager's schedule is that they
                understand the cost.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
