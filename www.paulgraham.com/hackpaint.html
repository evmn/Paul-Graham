programmers.  Who are they, what motivates them, and what impact
will they have on the rest of us?<br><br>That impact is ever more visible.  Everything around us is becoming
computerized.  Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer.
Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon
your TV and VCR will be components in a computer network. Your car
has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in
1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store
are being replaced by the Internet.  What's next?<br><br><i>Hackers & Painters</i> examines the world of hackers and the
motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose
that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers
on a fast-moving tour of what he calls "an intellectual Wild West."<br><br>Why do kids who can't master high school end up
as some of the most powerful people in the world?  
What makes a startup succeed?
Will technology create a gap between those who understand it and
those who don't?  Will Microsoft
take over the Internet?  What to do about spam?<br><br>If you want to understand what hackers are up to, this book
will tell you.  And if you are a hacker, you'll probably recognize
in it a portrait of yourself.<br><br>

Creator/Director, Slashdot<br><br>"Paul Graham writes about the human side of the often enigmatic world of computer programming. This book will help you remember the enjoyment you got from science class when science was a romp through the mud and woods, a class like art where making a mess is accepted as part of the process. Paul is a true hacker with a broad business experience, deep technical understanding, an uncontrollably inquisitive mind, and a wonderful writing style. His no-nonsense evaluation of the software industry may irritate some pundits and therefore is well worth reading."<br><br>- <a href="http://www.eecs.harvard.edu/~smith/">Mike Smith</a>,

the subject matter varied and interesting."-->
"What Paul does, and does very well, is to take ideas and concepts

Director, OSDN; Co-evolver, Slashdot<br><br>"Written in an engaging, grab-you-by-the-lapels style, and because he's studied it, a lot of the argument is conducted via the metaphor of painting.

<!--
to question, to explore, to create, to take sides, to go for the goal. 
A hacker's experiences force him to make judgments and to state his 
opinions. Paul's opinions-- on public high schools as dreadful, 
mind-numbing prisons or on the design of programming languages as the 
art of making programs short-- challenge you to think. They reveal bad 
flaws in the conventional wisdom, and they demand that we come up with 
good responses."--><br><br>- <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/matthias/">Matthias Felleisen</a>, 
Northeastern University<br><br>"Since programmers create programs out of nothing, imagination is our only limitation. Thus, in the world of programming, the hero is the one who has great vision. Paul Graham is one of our contemporary heroes. He has the ability to embrace the vision, and to express it plainly. His works are my favorites, especially the ones describing language design. He explains secrets of programming, languages, and human nature that can only be learned from the hacker experience. This book shows you his great vision, and tells you the truth about the nature of hacking."<br><br>- <a href="http://www.rubyist.net/~matz/">Yukihiro "Matz" Matsumoto</a>, 
creator of Ruby<br><br>"So wonderful that its biggest problem is its title.... 
<i>How to Think Like a Computer Millionaire</i> would, I suspect, 
be a more popular title. It would certainly be apt."<br><br>- <a href="http://www.aaronsw.com/">Aaron Swartz</a><br><br>"Paul Graham tells it like it is, like it was, and like it will be. I 
learned much from reading <i>Hackers & Painters.</i> This high-tech 
guru's essays are a joy to read in content, style, and wit. His insider 
view of the entire process of a startup is rivetting, and his guide on
how to do it should be required for all high-tech gamblers."<br><br>- <a href="http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~dfried/">Daniel P. Friedman</a>, 
Indiana University<br><br>"A wonderful book and required reading. Paul helps others understand why 
I chose the name 'Software Arts' for the company Dan Bricklin and I started.
 Those who don't understand the language of software cannot consider 
themselves literate."<br><br>- <a href="http://www.frankston.com/">Bob Frankston</a>, co-founder, Software Arts<br><br><!--"<i>Hackers & Painters</i> embraces a profoundly humanist perspective, a 
refreshing contrast to many other books about computers. The prose is a joy, 
the math is straightforward, and what little code there is beautifully 
elegant. The result is a challenging series of essays on what should and 
does make hackers tick.--> 
"As an introductory programming instructor, I'm 
always on the lookout for inspiring works to give to students. A high schooler,
college freshman, or any motivated lay person, can read 
<i>Hackers & Painters</i>
and find out what, spiritually, designing and building great programs is all about. Highly recommended."<br><br>- <a href="http://costarica.cs.northwestern.edu/bmd/">Brian M. Dennis</a>, Northwestern University<br><br>"The language of programmers is rich in references to art and industrial 
design. Paul Graham, whose training and experience spans these areas, 
offers an illuminating tour of this relationship in essays peppered 
with trenchant observation, humor, and art (some
visual, some parenthetical)."
<!-- Graham's style is enviably successful at communicating with students, while his guiding principles for 
programming language design should inspire a new generation of 
linguistic wonders."--><br><br>- <a href="http://www.cs.brown.edu/~sk/">Shriram Krishnamurthi</a>,
