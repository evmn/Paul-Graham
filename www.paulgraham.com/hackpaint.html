  <h1>
   Hackers &amp; Painters
  </h1>
  <p>
   We live in the computer age, a world increasingly shaped by
programmers.  Who are they, what motivates them, and what impact
will they have on the rest of us?
  </p>
  <p>
   That impact is ever more visible.  Everything around us is becoming
computerized.  Your typewriter is gone, replaced by a computer.
Your phone has turned into a computer. So has your camera. Soon
your TV and VCR will be components in a computer network. Your car
has more processing power in it than a room-sized mainframe did in
1970. Letters, encyclopedias, newspapers, and even your local store
are being replaced by the Internet.  What's next?
  </p>
  <p>
   <i>
    Hackers &amp; Painters
   </i>
   examines the world of hackers and the
motivations of the people who occupy it. In clear, thoughtful prose
that draws on illuminating historical examples, Graham takes readers
on a fast-moving tour of what he calls "an intellectual Wild West."
  </p>
  <p>
   Why do kids who can't master high school end up
as some of the most powerful people in the world?  
What makes a startup succeed?
Will technology create a gap between those who understand it and
those who don't?  Will Microsoft
take over the Internet?  What to do about spam?
  </p>
  <p>
   If you want to understand what hackers are up to, this book
will tell you.  And if you are a hacker, you'll probably recognize
in it a portrait of yourself.

    nerds unpopular?-- is worth the price of admission alone."

You get to share Paul's sense that the Universe is a fascinating place, and his knack for looking at it from an unusual angle."

doesn't matter if you're learning why nerds get beat up in high school,

    "Paul Graham writes about the human side of the often enigmatic world of computer programming. This book will help you remember the enjoyment you got from science class when science was a romp through the mud and woods, a class like art where making a mess is accepted as part of the process. Paul is a true hacker with a broad business experience, deep technical understanding, an uncontrollably inquisitive mind, and a wonderful writing style. His no-nonsense evaluation of the software industry may irritate some pundits and therefore is well worth reading."

to question, to explore, to create, to take sides, to go for the goal. 
A hacker's experiences force him to make judgments and to state his 
opinions. Paul's opinions-- on public high schools as dreadful, 
mind-numbing prisons or on the design of programming languages as the 
art of making programs short-- challenge you to think. They reveal bad 
flaws in the conventional wisdom, and they demand that we come up with 
good responses."-->

    "Since programmers create programs out of nothing, imagination is our only limitation. Thus, in the world of programming, the hero is the one who has great vision. Paul Graham is one of our contemporary heroes. He has the ability to embrace the vision, and to express it plainly. His works are my favorites, especially the ones describing language design. He explains secrets of programming, languages, and human nature that can only be learned from the hacker experience. This book shows you his great vision, and tells you the truth about the nature of hacking."

    <!--"<i>Hackers & Painters</i> embraces a profoundly humanist perspective, a 
refreshing contrast to many other books about computers. The prose is a joy, 
the math is straightforward, and what little code there is beautifully 
elegant. The result is a challenging series of essays on what should and 
does make hackers tick.-->
    "As an introductory programming instructor, I'm 
always on the lookout for inspiring works to give to students. A high schooler,
college freshman, or any motivated lay person, can read
    <i>
     Hackers &amp; Painters
    </i>
    and find out what, spiritually, designing and building great programs is all about. Highly recommended."
