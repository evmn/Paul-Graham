   Bel is a spec for a new dialect of Lisp, written in itself. This should sound familiar to people who know about Lisp's origins, because it's
   <a href="rootsoflisp.html">
    the way Lisp began
   </a>
   .
  </p>
  <p>
   It consists of two text files meant to be read in parallel: a

    guide to the Bel language
   </a>
   , and the
   <a href="https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/bel.bel?t=1595850613&amp;">
    Bel source
   </a>
   .
  </p>

   For those who just want to see some code examples, there's a
   <a href="https://sep.yimg.com/ty/cdn/paulgraham/belexamples.txt?t=1595850613&amp;">
    file of those
   </a>
   . But of course the Bel source is also a code example, since it's written in itself.

   Considering the rate at which I was discovering bugs before publishing Bel, there are bound to be more remaining. So this first version is version C, after Cunningham's Law.
