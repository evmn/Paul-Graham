        <article>January 2012<br><br>A few hours before the Yahoo
                acquisition was announced in June 1998
                I took a <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb">snapshot of
                        Viaweb's
                        site</a>. I thought it might be interesting to
                look at one day.<br><br>The first thing one notices is
                is how tiny the pages are. Screens
                were a lot smaller in 1998. If I remember correctly, our
                frontpage
                used to just fit in the size window people typically
                used then.<br><br>Browsers then (IE 6 was still 3 years
                in the future) had few fonts
                and they weren't antialiased. If you wanted to make
                pages that
                looked good, you had to render display text as
                images.<br><br>You may notice a certain similarity
                between the Viaweb and <a href="http://ycombinator.com">Y Combinator</a>
                logos. We did that
                as an inside joke when we started YC. Considering how
                basic a red
                circle is, it seemed surprising to me when we started
                Viaweb how
                few other companies used one as their logo. A bit later
                I realized
                <a href="zero.html">why</a>.<br><br>On the <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/com.html">Company
                        page</a> you'll notice a mysterious individual
                called John McArtyem.
                Robert Morris (aka Rtm) was so publicity averse after
                the
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Morris_worm">Worm</a>
                that he
                didn't want his name on the site. I managed to get him
                to agree
                to a compromise: we could use his bio but not his name.
                He has
                since <a href="http://ycombinator.com/people.html">relaxed</a>
                a bit
                on that point.<br><br>Trevor graduated at about the same
                time the acquisition closed, so in the
                course of 4 days he went from impecunious grad student
                to millionaire
                PhD. The culmination of my career as a writer of press
                releases
                was one <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/trevor.html">celebrating
                        his graduation</a>, illustrated with a drawing I
                did of him during
                a meeting.<br><br>(Trevor also appears as <a
                        href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/tlbwebdesign.html">Trevino
                        Bagwell</a> in our directory of web designers
                merchants could hire
                to build stores for them. We inserted him as a ringer in
                case some
                competitor tried to spam our web designers. We assumed
                his logo
                would deter any actual customers, but it did
                not.)<br><br>Back in the 90s, to get users you had to
                get mentioned in magazines
                and newspapers. There were not the same ways to get
                found online
                that there are today. So we used to pay a <a href="submarine.html">PR
                        firm</a> $16,000 a month to get us mentioned in
                the press. Fortunately
                reporters <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/presquot.html">liked
                        us</a>.<br><br>In our <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/se.html">advice
                        about
                        getting traffic from search engines</a> (I don't
                think the term SEO
                had been coined yet), we say there are only 7 that
                matter: Yahoo,
                AltaVista, Excite, WebCrawler, InfoSeek, Lycos, and
                HotBot. Notice
                anything missing? Google was incorporated that
                September.<br><br>We supported online transactions via a
                company called
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CyberCash,_Inc.">Cybercash</a>,
                since if we lacked that feature we'd have gotten beaten
                up in product
                comparisons. But Cybercash was so bad and most stores'
                order volumes
                were so low that it was better if merchants processed
                orders like phone orders. We had a page in our site
                trying to <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/cybercash.html">talk
                        merchants
                        out of doing real time
                        authorizations</a>.<br><br>The whole site was
                organized like a funnel, directing people to the
                <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/tesdriv.html">test
                        drive</a>.
                It was a novel thing to be able to try out software
                online. We put
                cgi-bin in our dynamic urls to fool competitors about
                how our
                software worked.<br><br>We had some <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/us.html">well
                        known users</a>. Needless to say, Frederick's of
                Hollywood got the
                most traffic. We charged a flat fee of $300/month for
                big stores,
                so it was a little alarming to have users who got lots
                of traffic.
                I once calculated how much Frederick's was costing us in
                bandwidth,
                and it was about $300/month.<br><br>Since we hosted all
                the stores, which together were getting just
                over 10 million page views per month in June 1998, we
                consumed what
                at the time seemed a lot of bandwidth. We had 2 T1s (3
                Mb/sec)
                coming into our offices. In those days there was no AWS.
                Even
                colocating servers seemed too risky, considering how
                often things
                went wrong with them. So we had our servers in our
                offices. Or
                more precisely, in Trevor's office. In return for the
                unique
                privilege of sharing his office with no other humans, he
                had to
                share it with 6 shrieking tower servers. His office was
                nicknamed
                the Hot Tub on account of the heat they generated. Most
                days his
                stack of window air conditioners could keep
                up.<br><br>For describing pages, we had a template
                language called <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/rtml.html">RTML</a>,
                which
                supposedly stood for something, but which in fact I
                named after
                Rtm. RTML was Common Lisp augmented by some macros and
                libraries,
                and concealed under a structure editor that made it look
                like it
                had syntax.<br><br>Since we did continuous releases, our
                software didn't actually have
                versions. But in those days the trade press expected
                versions, so
                we made them up. If we wanted to get lots of attention,
                we made
                the version number <a href="http://www.ycombinator.com/viaweb/rel4.html">an
                        integer</a>. That "version 4.0" icon was
                generated by our own
                button generator, incidentally. The whole Viaweb site
                was made
                with our software, even though it wasn't an online
                store, because
                we wanted to experience what our users did.<br><br>At
                the end of 1997, we released a general purpose shopping
                search
                engine called <a href="http://ycombinator.com/viaweb/shoprel.html">Shopfind</a>.
                It
                was pretty advanced for the time. It had a programmable
                crawler
                that could crawl most of the different stores online and
                pick out
                the products.<br><br>
