    We often get mail saying:
    <i>
     you should take a look at 
Language X; it has some really cool features.
    </i>
   </p>
   <p>
    We're ready to embrace
(and extend) any great new ideas that are out there, but there
are just too many languages for us to learn them all.
   </p>
   <p>
    That's where you can help.  If some other language has
a core language feature that impresses you, make a post
describing it on the
    <a href="http://arclanguage.org/forum">
     Arc
Forum
    </a>
    , along with, if applicable, the presumably 
kludgier code you'd have to write in Arc to do the same thing.
    <!--
(Note: We want core language features, not just libraries that
happen to have been written for Language X and not for
other languages.) -->
