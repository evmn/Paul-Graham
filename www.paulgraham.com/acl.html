   <ul>
    <li>
     An up-to-date reference manual for ANSI Common Lisp.
     <li>
      An in-depth look at object-oriented programming.  Explains the
Common Lisp Object System (CLOS), and also shows how to write your own
object-oriented language.
      <li>
       Over 20 substantial examples, including programs for ray-tracing,
text generation, pattern-matching, logical inference, generating HTML,
sorting and searching, file I/O, compression, and date arithmetic.
       <li>
        Special attention to critical concepts,
including prefix syntax, code
vs. data, recursion, functional programming, types, implicit pointers,
dynamic allocation, closures, macros, class precedence, and generic
functions vs.  message-passing.
        <li>
         A complete guide to optimization.
         <li>
          The clearest and most thorough explanation of macros in any
introductory book.
          <li>
           Examples that illustrate Lisp programming styles, including rapid
prototyping, bottom-up programming, object-oriented programming, and
embedded languages.
           <li>
            An appendix on debugging, with examples of common errors.

    "A straightforward and well-written tutorial and reference to
elementary and intermediate ANSI Common Lisp. It's more than just an
introductory book-- because of its extensive reference section, it may
be, for most readers, a useful alternative to Steele."
   </p>

    "This book would be ideal for a classroom text.  It is the only book
up-to-date with respect to the ANSI standard."

    "Paul Graham has done it again.  His first book,
    <i>
     On Lisp
    </i>
    , provided an
excellent description of some of the advanced features of Lisp while
the present one provides a completely thorough introduction to the
language, including such topics as tuning a program for speed."
   </p>
   <p>
    - Thomas Cheatham, Harvard University
   </p>
   <p>
    "The final chapter is brilliant.  It simultaneously explains some of
the key ideas behind object-oriented programming and takes the reader
through several versions of an object-oriented system, each more
sophisticated than the previous."
   </p>
   <p>
    - David Touretzky, Carnegie-Mellon University
   </p>
   <p>
    "Graham's well-known text
    <i>
     On Lisp
    </i>
    set a new standard for books on
advanced Lisp programming. With
    <i>
     ANSI Common Lisp
    </i>
    he has provided the
ideal introductory text--a compact tutorial and a complete reference
on the latest standard.  This book would be excellent either for a
standalone Lisp or functional programming course or for courses on AI,
compilers, or object-oriented programming that use Lisp.  I will
certainly be using it in my courses, and my students will be happy
that they no longer have to buy both a Lisp text and Steele's
reference.  I would also recommend it highly to programmers wishing to
move into the Lisp language.  The style is intelligent and lively, the
examples are interesting and well-chosen, and the standard of
explanation is impeccable."

    "The book's clear and engaging format explains complicated constructs simply. 
This format makes
    <i>
     ANSI Common Lisp
    </i>
    accessible to a general audience--even 
those who have never programmed before."
