   Probability
  </h1>
  <p>
   Suppose 
that being over 7 feet tall indicates with 60% probability that someone
is a basketball player, and carrying a basketball indicates this with 72% 
probability.  If you see someone who
is over 7 feet tall
   <i>
    and
   </i>
   carrying a basketball, what is the probability
that they're a basketball player?
  </p>
  <p>
   If
  
   a
  
  and
  
   b
  
  are 
the probabilities associated with two independent pieces of evidence,
then combined they indicate a probability of:
  </p>
  <p>
   <pre>
       ab
-------------------
ab + (1 - a)(1 - b)
</pre>
   So in this case our answer is:
  </p>
  <p>
   <pre>
         (.60)(.72)
-------------------------------
(.60)(.72) + (1 - .60)(1 - .72)
</pre>
   which is .794.  There is a 79.4% chance that the person is a basketball player.
  </p>
  <p>
   When there are more than two pieces of evidence, the formula expands
as you might expect:
  </p>
  <p>
   <pre>
            abc           
---------------------------
abc + (1 - a)(1 - b)(1 - c)
</pre>
   In the case of spam filtering, what we want to calculate is the probability
that the mail is a spam, and the individual pieces of evidence
  
   a, b, c, ...
  
  are the
spam probabilities associated with each of the words in the mail.
