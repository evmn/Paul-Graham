        <article>November 2008<br><br>One of the differences between big
                companies and startups is that
                big companies tend to have developed procedures to
                protect themselves
                against mistakes. A startup walks like a toddler,
                bashing
                into things and falling over all the time. A big company
                is more
                deliberate.<br><br>The gradual accumulation of checks in
                an organization is a kind of
                learning, based on disasters that have happened to it or
                others
                like it. After giving a contract to a supplier who goes
                bankrupt
                and fails to deliver, for example, a company might
                require all
                suppliers to prove they're solvent before submitting
                bids.<br><br>As companies grow they invariably get more
                such checks, either in
                response to disasters they've suffered, or (probably
                more often)
                by hiring people from bigger companies who bring with
                them customs
                for protecting against new types of
                disasters.<br><br>It's natural for organizations to
                learn from mistakes. The problem
                is, people who propose new checks almost never consider
                that the
                check itself has a cost.<br><br><i>Every check has a
                        cost.</i> For example, consider the case of
                making
                suppliers verify their solvency. Surely that's mere
                prudence? But
                in fact it could have substantial costs. There's
                obviously the
                direct cost in time of the people on both sides who
                supply and check
                proofs of the supplier's solvency. But the real costs
                are the ones
                you never hear about: the company that would be the best
                supplier,
                but doesn't bid because they can't spare the effort to
                get verified.
                Or the company that would be the best supplier, but
                falls just short
                of the threshold for solvency&mdash;which will of course
                have been set
                on the high side, since there is no apparent cost of
                increasing it.<br><br>Whenever someone in an
                organization proposes to add a new check,
                they should have to explain not just the benefit but the
                cost. No
                matter how bad a job they did of analyzing it, this
                meta-check would
                at least remind everyone there had to <i>be</i> a cost,
                and send them
                looking for it.<br><br>If companies started doing that,
                they'd find some surprises. Joel
                Spolsky recently spoke at Y Combinator about selling
                software to
                corporate customers. He said that in most companies
                software costing
                up to about $1000 could be bought by individual managers
                without
                any additional approvals. Above that threshold, software
                purchases
                generally had to be approved by a committee. But
                babysitting this
                process was so expensive for software vendors that it
                didn't make
                sense to charge less than $50,000. Which means if you're
                making
                something you might otherwise have charged $5000 for,
                you have to
                sell it for $50,000 instead.<br><br>The purpose of the
                committee is presumably to ensure that the company
                doesn't waste money. And yet the result is that the
                company pays
                10 times as much.<br><br>Checks on purchases will always
                be expensive, because the harder
                it is to sell something to you, the more it has to cost.
                And not
                merely linearly, either. If you're hard enough to sell
                to, the
                people who are best at making things don't want to
                bother. The
                only people who will sell to you are companies that
                specialize in
                selling to you. Then you've sunk to a whole new level of
                inefficiency.
                Market mechanisms no longer protect you, because the
                good suppliers
                are no longer in the market.<br><br>Such things happen
                constantly to the biggest organizations of all,
                governments. But checks instituted by governments can
                cause much
                worse problems than merely overpaying. Checks instituted
                by
                governments can cripple a country's whole economy. Up
                till about
                1400, China was richer and more technologically advanced
                than Europe.
                One reason Europe pulled ahead was that the Chinese
                government
                restricted long trading voyages. So it was left to the
                Europeans
                to explore and eventually to dominate the rest of the
                world, including
                China.<br><br>In more recent times, Sarbanes-Oxley has
                practically destroyed the
                US IPO market. That wasn't the intention of the
                legislators who
                wrote it. They just wanted to add a few more checks on
                public
                companies. But they forgot to consider the cost. They
                forgot that
                companies about to go public are usually rather
                stretched, and that
                the weight of a few extra checks that might be easy for
                General
                Electric to bear are enough to prevent younger companies
                from being
                public at all.<br><br>Once you start to think about the
                cost of checks, you can start to
                ask other interesting questions. Is the cost increasing
                or decreasing?
                Is it higher in some areas than others? Where does it
                increase
                discontinuously? If large organizations started to ask
                questions
                like that, they'd learn some frightening
                things.<br><br>I think the cost of checks may actually
                be increasing. The reason
                is that software plays an increasingly important role in
                companies,
                and the people who write software are particularly
                harmed by checks.<br><br>Programmers are unlike many
                types of workers in that the best ones
                actually prefer to work hard. This doesn't seem to be
                the case in
                most types of work. When I worked in fast food, we
                didn't prefer
                the busy times. And when I used to mow lawns, I
                definitely didn't
                prefer it when the grass was long after a week of
                rain.<br><br>Programmers, though, like it better when
                they write more code. Or
                more precisely, when they release more code. Programmers
                like to
                make a difference. Good ones, anyway.<br><br>For good
                programmers, one of the best things about working for a
                startup is that there are few checks on releases. In
                true startups,
                there are no external checks at all. If you have an idea
                for a new
                feature in the morning, you can write it and push it to
                the production
                servers before lunch. And when you can do that, you have
                more
                ideas.<br><br>At big companies, software has to go
                through various approvals
                before it can be launched. And the cost of doing this
                can be
                enormous&mdash;in fact, discontinuous. I was talking
                recently to a
                group of three programmers whose startup had been
                acquired a few
                years before by a big company. When they'd been
                independent, they
                could release changes instantly. Now, they said, the
                absolute
                fastest they could get code released on the production
                servers was
                two weeks.<br><br>This didn't merely make them less
                productive. It made them hate
                working for the acquirer.<br><br>Here's a sign of how
                much programmers like to be able to work hard:
                these guys would have <i>paid</i> to be able to release
                code immediately,
                the way they used to. I asked them if they'd trade 10%
                of the
                acquisition price for the ability to release code
                immediately, and
                all three instantly said yes. Then I asked what was the
                maximum
                percentage of the acquisition price they'd trade for it.
                They said
                they didn't want to think about it, because they didn't
                want to
                know how high they'd go, but I got the impression it
                might be as
                much as half.<br><br>They'd have sacrificed hundreds of
                thousands of dollars, perhaps
                millions, just to be able to deliver more software to
                users. And
                you know what? It would have been perfectly safe to let
                them. In
                fact, the acquirer would have been better off; not only
                wouldn't
                these guys have broken anything, they'd have gotten a
                lot more done.
                So the acquirer is in fact getting worse performance at
                greater
                cost. Just like the committee approving software
                purchases.<br><br>And just as the greatest danger of
                being hard to sell to is not
                that you overpay but that the best suppliers won't even
                sell to
                you, the greatest danger of applying too many checks to
                your
                programmers is not that you'll make them unproductive,
                but that
                good programmers won't even want to work for
                you.<br><br>Steve Jobs's famous maxim "artists ship"
                works both ways. Artists
                aren't merely capable of shipping. They insist on it. So
                if you
                don't let people ship, you won't have any
                artists.<br><br></article>
