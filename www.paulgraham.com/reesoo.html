<i>(Jonathan Rees had a really interesting response to <a href="noop.html">Why
Arc isn't Especially Object-Oriented</a>, which he has allowed me to reproduce
here.)</i><br><br>Here is an a la carte menu of features or properties that are related
                    to these terms; I have heard OO defined to be many different subsets
                    of this list.<br><br><ol>
<li> Encapsulation - the ability to syntactically hide the
                       implementation of a type.  E.g. in C or Pascal you always know
                       whether something is a struct or an array, but in CLU and Java you
                       can hide the difference.<br><br><li> Protection - the inability of the client of a type to detect its
                       implementation.  This guarantees that a behavior-preserving change
                       to an implementation will not break its clients, and also makes
                       sure that things like passwords don't leak out.<br><br><li> Ad hoc polymorphism - functions and data structures with parameters 
                       that can take on values of many different types.<br><br><li> Parametric polymorphism - functions and data structures that
                       parameterize over arbitrary values (e.g. list of anything).
                       ML and Lisp both have this.  Java doesn't quite because of
                       its non-Object types.<br><br><li> Everything is an object - all values are objects.  True in Smalltalk
                       (?) but not in Java (because of int and friends).<br><br><li> All you can do is send a message (AYCDISAM) = Actors model - there
                       is no direct manipulation of objects, only communication with (or
                       invocation of) them.  The presence of fields in Java violates this.<br><br><li> Specification inheritance = subtyping - there are distinct
                       types known to the language with the property that a value of
                       one type is as good as a value of another for the purposes of type
                       correctness.  (E.g. Java interface inheritance.)<br><br><li> Implementation inheritance/reuse - having written one pile of code,
                       a similar pile (e.g. a superset) can be generated in a controlled
                       manner, i.e. the code doesn't have to be copied and edited.  A
                       limited and peculiar kind of abstraction.  (E.g. Java class
                       inheritance.)<br><br><li> Sum-of-product-of-function pattern - objects are (in effect)
                       restricted to be functions that take as first argument a
                       distinguished method key argument that is drawn from a finite set
                       of simple names.
</ol>
<p align=justif>
                    So OO is not a well defined concept.  Some people (eg. Abelson and
                    Sussman?) say Lisp is OO, by which they mean {3,4,5,7} (with the
                    proviso that all types are in the programmers' heads).  Java is
                    supposed to be OO because of {1,2,3,7,8,9}.  E is supposed to be more
                    OO than Java because it has {1,2,3,4,5,7,9} and almost has 6; 8
                    (subclassing) is seen as antagonistic to E's goals and not necessary
                    for OO.<br><br>The conventional Simula 67-like pattern of class and instance will get
                    you {1,3,7,9}, and I think many people take this as a definition of
                    OO.<br><br>Because OO is a moving target, OO zealots will choose some subset of
                    this menu by whim and then use it to try to convince you that you are
                    a loser.<br><br>Perhaps part of the confusion - and you say this in a different way in
                    your little <a href="noop.html">memo</a> - is that the C/C++ folks see OO as a liberation from
                    a world that has nothing resembling a first-class functions, while
                    Lisp folks see OO as a prison since it limits their use of
                    functions/objects to the style of (9.).  In that case, the only way OO
                    can be defended is in the same manner as any other game or discipline
                     — by arguing that by giving something up (e.g. the freedom to throw
                    eggs at your neighbor's house) you gain something that you want
                    (assurance that your neighbor won't put you in jail).<br><br>This is related to Lisp being oriented to the solitary hacker and
                    discipline-imposing languages being oriented to social packs, another
                    point you mention.  In a pack you want to restrict everyone else's
                    freedom as much as possible to reduce their ability to interfere with
                    and take advantage of you, and the only way to do that is by either
                    becoming chief (dangerous and unlikely) or by submitting to the same
                    rules that they do.  If you submit to rules, you then want the rules
                    to be liberal so that you have a chance of doing most of what you want
                    to do, but not so liberal that others nail you.<br><br>In such a pack-programming world, the language is a constitution or
                    set of by-laws, and the interpreter/compiler/QA dept. acts in part as
                    a rule checker/enforcer/police force.  Co-programmers want to know: If
                    I work with your code, will this help me or hurt me?  Correctness is
                    undecidable (and generally unenforceable), so managers go with
                    whatever rule set (static type system, language restrictions, "lint"
                    program, etc.) shows up at the door when the project starts.<br><br>I recently contributed to a discussion of anti-OO on the e-lang list.
                    My main anti-OO message (actually it only attacks points 5/6)
                    was
<a href="http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/e-lang/2001-October/005852.html"
> http://www.eros-os.org/pipermail/e-lang/2001-October/005852.html</a>.
                    The followups are interesting but I don't think they're all threaded
                    properly.<br><br>(Here are the pet definitions of terms used above:<br><br><ul>
<li> Value = something that can be passed to some function (abstraction).
                      (I exclude exotic compile-time things like parameters to
                      macros and to parameterized types and modules.)<br><br><li> Object = a value that has function-like behavior, i.e. you can
                      invoke a method on it or call it or send it a message or something
                      like that.  Some people define object more strictly along the lines
                      of 9. above, while others (e.g. CLTL) are more liberal.  This is
                      what makes "everything is an object" a vacuous statement in the
                      absence of clear definitions.<br><br>In some languages the "call" is curried and the key-to-method
                      mapping can sometimes be done at compile time.  This technicality
                      can cloud discussions of OO in C++ and related languages.<br><br><li> Function = something that can be combined with particular
                      parameter(s) to produce some result.  Might or might not be the same
                      as object depending on the language.<br><br><li> Type = a description of the space of values over which a function is
                      meaningfully parameterized.  I include both types known to the
                      language and types that exist in the programmer's mind or
                      in documentation.
