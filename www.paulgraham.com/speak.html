        <article>March 2012<br><br>I'm not a very good speaker. I say
                "um" a lot. Sometimes I have
                to pause when I lose my train of thought. I wish I were
                a better
                speaker. But I don't wish I were a better speaker like I
                wish I
                were a better writer. What I really want is to have good
                ideas,
                and that's a much bigger part of being a good writer
                than being a
                good speaker.<br><br>Having good ideas is most of
                writing well. If you know what you're
                talking about, you can say it in the plainest words and
                you'll be
                perceived as having a good style. With speaking it's the
                opposite:
                having good ideas is an alarmingly small component of
                being a good
                speaker.<br><br>I first noticed this at a conference
                several years ago.
                There was another speaker who was much better than me.
                He had all of us roaring with laughter. I seemed awkward
                and
                halting by comparison. Afterward I put my talk online
                like I usually
                do. As I was doing it I tried to imagine what a
                transcript of the
                other guy's talk would be like, and it was only then I
                realized he
                hadn't said very much.<br><br>Maybe this would have been
                obvious to someone who knew more about
                speaking, but it was a revelation to me how much less
                ideas mattered
                in speaking than writing.

                        </a>]</font><br><br>A few years later I heard a
                talk by someone who was not merely a
                better speaker than me, but a famous speaker. Boy was he
                good. So
                I decided I'd pay close attention to what he said, to
                learn how he
                did it. After about ten sentences I found myself
                thinking "I don't
                want to be a good speaker."<br><br>Being a really good
                speaker is not merely orthogonal to having good ideas,
                but in many ways pushes you in the opposite direction.
                For example,
                when I give a talk, I usually write it out beforehand. I
                know that's
                a mistake; I know delivering a
                <nota href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UF8uR6Z6KLc">
                        prewritten</a>
                        talk makes it harder to
                        engage with an audience. The way to get the
                        attention of an audience
                        is to give them <i>your</i> full attention, and
                        when you're delivering
                        a prewritten talk, your attention is always
                        divided between the
                        audience and the talk &mdash; even if you've
                        memorized it. If you want
                        to engage an audience, it's better to start with
                        no more than an outline
                        of what you want to say and
                        <nota href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vmG9jzCHtSQ">
                                ad lib</a> the individual sentences. But
                                if you do that, you might spend no more
                                time thinking about each
                                sentence than it takes to say it.

                                Occasionally the stimulation
                                of talking to a live audience makes you
                                think of new things, but
                                in general this is not going to generate
                                ideas as well as writing
                                does, where you can spend as long on
                                each sentence as you want.<br><br>If you
                                rehearse a prewritten speech enough, you
                                can get
                                asymptotically close to the sort of
                                engagement you get when speaking
                                ad lib. Actors do. But here again
                                there's a tradeoff between
                                smoothness and ideas. All the time you
                                spend practicing a talk,
                                you could instead spend making it
                                better. Actors don't face
                                that temptation, except in the rare
                                cases where they've written the
                                script, but any speaker does. Before I
                                give a talk I can usually
                                be found sitting in a corner somewhere
                                with a copy printed out on
                                paper, trying to rehearse it in my head.
                                But I always end up
                                spending most of the time rewriting it
                                instead. Every talk I give
                                ends up being given from a manuscript
                                full of things crossed out
                                and rewritten. Which of course makes me
                                um even more, because I
                                haven't had any time to practice the new
                                bits.

                                your audience, there are even worse
                                tradeoffs than
                                these. Audiences like to be flattered;
                                they like jokes; they like
                                to be swept off their feet by a vigorous
                                stream of words. As you
                                decrease the intelligence of the
                                audience, being a good speaker is
                                increasingly a matter of being a good
                                bullshitter. That's true in
                                writing too of course, but the descent
                                is steeper with talks. Any
                                given person is dumber as a member of an
                                audience than as a reader.
                                Just as a speaker ad libbing can only
                                spend as long thinking about
                                each sentence as it takes to say it, a
                                person hearing a talk can
                                only spend as long thinking about each
                                sentence as it takes to hear
                                it. Plus people in an audience are
                                always affected by the reactions
                                of those around them, and the reactions
                                that spread from person to
                                person in an audience are
                                disproportionately the more brutish
                                sort,
                                just as low notes travel through walls
                                better than high ones. Every
                                audience is an incipient mob, and a good
                                speaker uses that. Part
                                of the reason I laughed so much at the
                                talk by the good speaker at
                                that conference was that everyone else
                                did.

                                useless? They're certainly inferior to
                                the written
                                word as a source of ideas. But that's
                                not all talks are good for.
                                When I go to a talk, it's usually
                                because I'm interested in the
                                speaker. Listening to a talk is the
                                closest most of us can get to
                                having a conversation with someone like
                                the president, who doesn't
                                have time to meet individually with all
                                the people who want to meet
                                him.<br><br>Talks are also good at
                                motivating me to do things. It's
                                probably
                                no coincidence that so many famous
                                speakers are described as
                                motivational speakers. That may be what
                                public speaking is really
                                for. It's probably what it was
                                originally for. The emotional
                                reactions you can elicit with a talk can
                                be a powerful force.
                                I wish I could say that this force was
                                more often used for good than
                                ill, but I'm not
                                sure.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n">

                                talks, which are a
                                different type of thing. While the
                                audience at an academic talk might
                                appreciate a joke, they will (or
                                at least should) make a conscious effort
                                to see what new ideas
                                you're presenting.<br><br>[<a name="f2n">

                                That's the lower bound. In practice you
                                can often do better,
                                because talks are usually about things
                                you've written or talked
                                about before, and when you ad lib, you
                                end up reproducing some of
                                those sentences. Like early medieval
                                architecture, impromptu talks
                                are made of spolia. Which feels a bit
                                dishonest, incidentally,
                                because you have to deliver these
                                sentences as if you'd just thought
                                of them.<br><br>[<a name="f3n">

                                Robert Morris points out that there is a
                                way in which practicing
                                talks makes them better: reading a talk
                                out loud can expose awkward
                                parts. I agree and in fact I read most
                                things I write out loud at
                                least once for that reason.<br><br>[<a name="f4n">

                                For sufficiently small audiences, it may
                                not be true that being
                                part of an audience makes people dumber.
                                The real decline seems
                                to set in when the audience gets too big
                                for the talk to feel like
                                a conversation &mdash; maybe around 10
                                people.<br><br>
