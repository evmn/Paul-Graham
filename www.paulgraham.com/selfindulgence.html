        <article>July 2010<br><br>When we sold our startup in 1998 I
                suddenly got a lot of money. I
                now had to think about something I hadn't had to think
                about before:
                how not to lose it. I knew it was possible to go from
                rich to
                poor, just as it was possible to go from poor to rich.
                But while
                I'd spent a lot of the past several years studying the
                paths from
                <a href="wealth.html">poor to rich</a>,
                I knew practically nothing about the paths from rich
                to poor. Now, in order to avoid them, I had to learn
                where they
                were.<br><br>So I started to pay attention to how
                fortunes are lost. If you'd
                asked me as a kid how rich people became poor, I'd have
                said by
                spending all their money. That's how it happens in books
                and movies,
                because that's the colorful way to do it. But in fact
                the way most
                fortunes are lost is not through excessive expenditure,
                but through
                bad investments.<br><br>It's hard to spend a fortune
                without noticing. Someone with ordinary
                tastes would find it hard to blow through more than a
                few tens of
                thousands of dollars without thinking "wow, I'm spending
                a lot of
                money." Whereas if you start trading derivatives, you
                can lose a
                million dollars (as much as you want, really) in the
                blink of an
                eye.<br><br>In most people's minds, spending money on
                luxuries sets off alarms
                that making investments doesn't. Luxuries seem
                self-indulgent.
                And unless you got the money by inheriting it or winning
                a lottery,
                you've already been thoroughly trained that
                self-indulgence leads
                to trouble. Investing bypasses those alarms. You're not
                spending
                the money; you're just moving it from one asset to
                another. Which
                is why people trying to sell you expensive things say
                "it's an
                investment."<br><br>The solution is to develop new
                alarms. This can be a tricky business,
                because while the alarms that prevent you from
                overspending are so
                basic that they may even be in our DNA, the ones that
                prevent you
                from making bad investments have to be learned, and are
                sometimes
                fairly counterintuitive.<br><br>A few days ago I
                realized something surprising: the situation with
                time is much the same as with money. The most dangerous
                way to
                lose time is not to spend it having fun, but to spend it
                doing fake
                work. When you spend time having fun, you know you're
                being
                self-indulgent. Alarms start to go off fairly quickly.
                If I woke
                up one morning and sat down on the sofa and watched TV
                all day, I'd
                feel like something was terribly wrong. Just thinking
                about it
                makes me wince. I'd start to feel uncomfortable after
                sitting on
                a sofa watching TV for 2 hours, let alone a whole
                day.<br><br>And yet I've definitely had days when I
                might as well have sat in
                front of a TV all day &mdash; days at the end of which,
                if I asked myself
                what I got done that day, the answer would have been:
                basically,
                nothing. I feel bad after these days too, but nothing
                like as bad
                as I'd feel if I spent the whole day on the sofa
                watching TV. If
                I spent a whole day watching TV I'd feel like I was
                descending into
                perdition. But the same alarms don't go off on the days
                when I get
                nothing done, because I'm doing stuff that seems,
                superficially,
                like real work. Dealing with email, for example. You do
                it sitting
                at a desk. It's not fun. So it must be work.<br><br>With
                time, as with money, avoiding pleasure is no longer
                enough to
                protect you. It probably was enough to protect
                hunter-gatherers,
                and perhaps all pre-industrial societies. So nature and
                nurture
                combine to make us avoid self-indulgence. But the world
                has gotten
                more complicated: the most dangerous traps now are new
                behaviors
                that bypass our alarms about self-indulgence by
                mimicking more
                virtuous types. And the worst thing is, they're not even
                fun.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
