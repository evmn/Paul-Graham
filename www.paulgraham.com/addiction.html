        <article>July 2010<br><br>What hard liquor, cigarettes, heroin,
                and crack have in common is
                that they're all more concentrated forms of less
                addictive predecessors.
                Most if not all the things we describe as addictive are.
                And the
                scary thing is, the process that created them is
                accelerating.<br><br>We wouldn't want to stop it. It's
                the same process that cures
                diseases: technological progress. Technological progress
                means
                making things do more of what we want. When the thing we
                want is
                something we want to want, we consider technological
                progress good.
                If some new technique makes solar cells x% more
                efficient, that
                seems strictly better. When progress concentrates
                something we
                don't want to want&mdash;when it transforms opium into
                heroin&mdash;it seems
                bad. But it's the same process at work.

                        </a>]</font><br><br>No one doubts this process
                is accelerating, which means increasing
                numbers of things we like will be transformed into
                things we like
                too much.
                <font color=#999999>[<a href="addiction.html#f2n">
                                <font color=#999999>2</font>
                        </a>]</font><br><br>As far as I know there's no
                word for something we like too much.
                The closest is the colloquial sense of "addictive." That
                usage has
                become increasingly common during my lifetime. And it's
                clear why:
                there are an increasing number of things we need it for.
                At the
                extreme end of the spectrum are crack and meth. Food has
                been
                transformed by a combination of factory farming and
                innovations in
                food processing into something with way more immediate
                bang for the
                buck, and you can see the results in any town in
                America. Checkers
                and solitaire have been replaced by World of Warcraft
                and FarmVille.
                TV has become much more engaging, and even so it <a href="convergence.html">can't compete</a> with
                Facebook.<br><br>The world is more addictive than it was
                40 years ago. And unless
                the forms of technological progress that produced these
                things are
                subject to different laws than technological progress in
                general,
                the world will get more addictive in the next 40 years
                than it did
                in the last 40.<br><br>The next 40 years will bring us
                some wonderful things. I don't
                mean to imply they're all to be avoided. Alcohol is a
                dangerous
                drug, but I'd rather live in a world with wine than one
                without.
                Most people can coexist with alcohol; but you have to be
                careful.
                More things we like will mean more things we have to be
                careful
                about.<br><br>Most people won't, unfortunately. Which
                means that as the world
                becomes more addictive, the two senses in which one can
                live a
                normal life will be driven ever further apart. One sense
                of "normal"
                is statistically normal: what everyone else does. The
                other is the
                sense we mean when we talk about the normal operating
                range of a
                piece of machinery: what works best.<br><br>These two
                senses are already quite far apart. Already someone
                trying to live well would seem eccentrically abstemious
                in most of
                the US. That phenomenon is only going to become more
                pronounced.
                You can probably take it as a rule of thumb from now on
                that if
                people don't think you're weird, you're living
                badly.<br><br>Societies eventually develop antibodies to
                addictive new things.
                I've seen that happen with cigarettes. When cigarettes
                first
                appeared, they spread the way an infectious disease
                spreads through
                a previously isolated population. Smoking rapidly became
                a
                (statistically) normal thing. There were ashtrays
                everywhere. We
                had ashtrays in our house when I was a kid, even though
                neither of
                my parents smoked. You had to for guests.<br><br>As
                knowledge spread about the dangers of smoking, customs
                changed.
                In the last 20 years, smoking has been transformed from
                something
                that seemed totally normal into a rather seedy habit:
                from something
                movie stars did in publicity shots to something small
                huddles of
                addicts do outside the doors of office buildings. A lot
                of the
                change was due to legislation, of course, but the
                legislation
                couldn't have happened if customs hadn't already
                changed.<br><br>It took a while though&mdash;on the
                order of 100 years. And unless the
                rate at which social antibodies evolve can increase to
                match the
                accelerating rate at which technological progress throws
                off new
                addictions, we'll be increasingly unable to rely on
                customs to
                protect us.

                        </a>]</font>
                Unless we want to be canaries in the coal mine
                of each new addiction&mdash;the people whose sad example
                becomes a
                lesson to future generations&mdash;we'll have to figure
                out for ourselves
                what to avoid and how. It will actually become a
                reasonable strategy
                (or a more reasonable strategy) to suspect
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paleolithic_diet">everything
                        new</a>.<br><br>In fact, even that won't be
                enough. We'll have to worry not just
                about new things, but also about existing things
                becoming more
                addictive. That's what bit me. I've avoided most
                addictions, but
                the Internet got me because it became addictive while I
                was using
                it.

                        </a>]</font><br><br>Most people I know have
                problems with Internet addiction. We're
                all trying to figure out our own customs for getting
                free of it.
                That's why I don't have an iPhone, for example; the last
                thing I
                want is for the Internet to follow me out into the
                world.
                <font color=#999999>[<a href="addiction.html#f5n">

                My latest trick is taking long hikes. I used to think
                running was a
                better form of exercise than hiking because it took less
                time. Now
                the slowness of hiking seems an advantage, because the
                longer I
                spend on the trail, the longer I have to think without
                interruption.<br><br>Sounds pretty eccentric, doesn't
                it? It always will when you're
                trying to solve problems where there are no customs yet
                to guide
                you. Maybe I can't plead Occam's razor; maybe I'm simply
                eccentric.
                But if I'm right about the acceleration of
                addictiveness, then this
                kind of lonely squirming to avoid it will increasingly
                be the fate
                of anyone who wants to get things done. We'll
                increasingly be
                defined by what we say no
                to.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>

                Could you restrict technological progress to areas where
                you
                wanted it? Only in a limited way, without becoming a
                police state.
                And even then your restrictions would have undesirable
                side effects.
                "Good" and "bad" technological progress aren't sharply
                differentiated,
                so you'd find you couldn't slow the latter without also
                slowing the
                former. And in any case, as Prohibition and the "war on
                drugs"
                show, bans often do more harm than good.<br><br>[<a name="f2n">

                Technology has always been accelerating. By Paleolithic
                standards, technology evolved at a blistering pace in
                the Neolithic
                period.<br><br>[<a name="f3n">

                Unless we mass produce social customs. I suspect the
                recent
                resurgence of evangelical Christianity in the US is
                partly a reaction
                to drugs. In desperation people reach for the
                sledgehammer; if
                their kids won't listen to them, maybe they'll listen to
                God. But
                that solution has broader consequences than just getting
                kids to
                say no to drugs. You end up saying no to
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbXgsMxOPtI">science</a>
                as well.

                        <br><br>I worry we may be heading for a future
                        in which only a few people
                        plot their own itinerary through no-land, while
                        everyone else books
                        a package tour. Or worse still, has one booked
                        for them by the
                        government.<br><br>[<a name="f4n">

                        People commonly use the word "procrastination"
                        to describe
                        what they do on the Internet. It seems to me too
                        mild to describe
                        what's happening as merely not-doing-work. We
                        don't call it
                        procrastination when someone gets drunk instead
                        of working.<br><br>[<a name="f5n">

                        Several people have told me they like the iPad
                        because it
                        lets them bring the Internet into situations
                        where a laptop would
                        be too conspicuous. In other words, it's a hip
                        flask. (This is
                        true of the iPhone too, of course, but this
                        advantage isn't as
                        obvious because it reads as a phone, and
                        everyone's used to those.)<br><br><b>Thanks</b>
