                                                                always the same.
                                                                Assuming their expenses remain constant and their

                                                                they make it to

                                                                don't know.
                                                                Half the founders I talk to don't know whether they're
                                                                default alive
                                                                or default dead.<br><br>If you're among that number,

                                                                you can use to find out.<br><br>The reason I want to
                                                                know first whether a startup is default alive
                                                                or default dead is that the rest of the conversation
                                                                depends on the
                                                                answer. If the company is default alive, we can talk
                                                                about ambitious
                                                                new things they could do. If it's default dead, we
                                                                probably need
                                                                to talk about how to save it. We know the current
                                                                trajectory ends
                                                                badly. How can they get off that trajectory?<br><br>Why
                                                                do so few founders know whether they're default alive or
                                                                default
                                                                dead? Mainly, I think, because they're not used to
                                                                asking that.
                                                                It's not a question that makes sense to ask early on,
                                                                any more than
                                                                it makes sense to ask a 3 year old how he plans to
                                                                support
                                                                himself. But as the company grows older, the question
                                                                switches from
                                                                meaningless to critical. That kind of switch often takes
                                                                people
                                                                by surprise.<br><br>I propose the following solution:
                                                                instead of starting to ask too
                                                                late whether you're default alive or default dead, start
                                                                asking too
                                                                early. It's hard to say precisely when the question
                                                                switches
                                                                polarity. But it's probably not that dangerous to start
                                                                worrying
                                                                too early that you're default dead, whereas it's very
                                                                dangerous to
                                                                start worrying too late.<br><br>The reason is a
                                                                phenomenon I wrote about earlier: the

                                                                The fatal pinch is default dead + slow growth + not
                                                                enough

                                                                not realizing
                                                                that's where they're headed.<br><br>There is another
                                                                reason founders don't ask themselves whether they're
                                                                default alive or default dead: they assume it will be
                                                                easy to raise

                                                                worse still, the

                                                                of the future with vague optimism, explicitly separate

                                                                Say "We're default dead, but we're counting on investors
                                                                to save
