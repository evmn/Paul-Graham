              <article>April 2007<br><br><i>(This essay is derived from a keynote talk at the 2007 ASES Summit
                  at Stanford.)</i><br><br>The world of investors is a foreign one to most hackers&mdash;partly
                because investors are so unlike hackers, and partly because they
                tend to operate in secret. I've been dealing with this world for
                many years, both as a founder and an investor, and I still don't
                fully understand it.<br><br>In this essay I'm going to list some of the more surprising things
                I've learned about investors. Some I only learned in the past year.<br><br>Teaching hackers how to deal
                with investors is probably the second
                most important thing we do at Y Combinator. The most important
                thing for a startup is to make something good. But everyone knows
                that's important. The dangerous thing about investors is that
                hackers don't know how little they know about this strange world.<br><br><b>1. The investors are what
                  make a startup hub.</b><br><br>About a year ago I tried to figure out what you'd need to reproduce
                <a href="siliconvalley.html">Silicon Valley</a>. I decided the
                critical ingredients were rich people
                and nerds&mdash;investors and founders. People are all you need to
                make technology, and all the other people will move.<br><br>If I had to narrow that down, I'd say
                investors are the limiting
                factor. Not because they contribute more to the startup, but simply
                because they're least willing to move. They're rich. They're not
                going to move to Albuquerque just because there are some smart
                hackers there they could invest in. Whereas hackers will move to
                the Bay Area to find investors.<br><br><b>2. Angel investors are the most critical.</b><br><br>There are
                several types of investors. The two main categories are
                angels and VCs: VCs invest other people's money, and angels invest
                their own.<br><br>Though they're less well known, the angel investors are probably
                the more critical ingredient in creating a silicon valley. Most
                companies that VCs invest in would never have made it that far if angels
                hadn't invested first. VCs say between half and three quarters of
                companies that raise series A rounds have taken some outside
                investment already.
                <font color=#777777>[<a href="guidetoinvestors.html#f1n">
                    <font color=#777777>1</font>
                  </a>]</font><br><br>Angels are willing to fund riskier projects than VCs. They also
                give valuable advice, because (unlike VCs) many have been startup
                founders themselves.<br><br>Google's story shows the key role angels play. A lot of people know
                Google raised money from Kleiner and Sequoia. What most don't realize
                is how late. That VC round was a series B round; the premoney
                valuation was $75 million. Google was already a successful company
                at that point. Really, Google was funded with angel money.<br><br>It may seem odd that the canonical
                Silicon Valley startup was funded
                by angels, but this is not so surprising. Risk is always proportionate
                to reward. So the most successful startup of all is likely to have
                seemed an extremely risky bet at first, and that is exactly the
                kind VCs won't touch.<br><br>Where do angel investors come from? From other startups. So startup
                hubs like Silicon Valley benefit from something like the marketplace
                effect, but shifted in time: startups are there because startups
                were there.<br><br><b>3. Angels don't like publicity.</b><br><br>If angels are so important, why do we
                hear more about VCs? Because
                VCs like publicity. They need to market themselves to the investors
                who are their "customers"&mdash;the endowments and pension funds and
                rich families whose money they invest&mdash;and also to founders who
                might come to them for funding.<br><br>Angels don't need to market themselves to investors because they
                invest their own money. Nor do they want to market themselves to
                founders: they don't want random people pestering them with business
                plans. Actually, neither do VCs. Both angels and VCs get deals
                almost exclusively through personal introductions.
                <font color=#777777>[<a href="guidetoinvestors.html#f2n">
                    <font color=#777777>2</font>
                  </a>]</font><br><br>The reason VCs want a strong brand is not to draw in more business
                plans over the transom, but so they win deals when competing
                against other VCs. Whereas angels are rarely in direct competition,
                because (a) they do fewer deals, (b) they're happy to split them,
                and (c) they invest at a point where the stream is broader.<br><br><b>4. Most investors, especially VCs,
                  are not like founders.</b><br><br>Some angels are, or were, hackers. But most VCs are a different
                type of people: they're dealmakers.<br><br>If you're a hacker, here's a thought experiment you can run
                to
                understand why there are basically no hacker VCs: How would you
                like a job where you never got to make anything, but instead spent
                all your time listening to other people pitch (mostly terrible)
                projects, deciding whether to fund them, and sitting on their boards
                if you did? That would not be fun for most hackers. Hackers like
                to make things. This would be like being an administrator.<br><br>Because most VCs are a different
                species of people from
                founders, it's hard to know what they're thinking. If you're a
                hacker, the last time you had to deal with these guys was in high
                school. Maybe in college you walked past their fraternity on your
                way to the lab. But don't underestimate them. They're as expert
                in their world as you are in yours. What they're good at is reading
                people, and making deals work to their advantage. Think twice
                before you try to beat them at that.<br><br><b>5. Most investors are momentum
                  investors.</b><br><br>Because most investors are dealmakers rather than technology people,
                they generally don't understand what you're doing. I knew as a
                founder that most VCs didn't get technology. I also knew some made
                a lot of money. And yet it never occurred to me till recently to
                put those two ideas together and ask "How can VCs make money by
                investing in stuff they don't understand?"<br><br>The answer is that they're like momentum investors.
                You can (or
                could once) make a lot of money by noticing sudden changes in stock
                prices. When a stock jumps upward, you buy, and when it suddenly
                drops, you sell. In effect you're insider trading, without knowing
                what you know. You just know someone knows something, and that's
                making the stock move.<br><br>This is how most venture investors operate. They don't try to look
                at something and predict whether it will take off. They win by
                noticing that something <i>is</i> taking off a little sooner than everyone
                else. That generates almost as good returns as actually being able
                to pick winners. They may have to pay a little more than they would
                if they got in at the very beginning, but only a little.<br><br>Investors always say what they really
                care about is the team.
                Actually what they care most about is your traffic, then what other
                investors think, then the team. If you don't yet have any traffic,
                they fall back on number 2, what other investors think. And this,
                as you can imagine, produces wild oscillations in the "stock price"
                of a startup. One week everyone wants you, and they're begging not
                to be cut out of the deal. But all it takes is for one big investor
                to cool on you, and the next week no one will return your phone
                calls. We regularly have startups go from hot to cold or cold to
                hot in a matter of days, and literally nothing has changed.<br><br>There are two ways to deal with this
                phenomenon. If you're feeling
                really confident, you can try to ride it. You can start by asking
                a comparatively lowly VC for a small amount of money, and then after
                generating interest there, ask more prestigious VCs for larger
                amounts, stirring up a crescendo of buzz, and then "sell" at the
                top. This is extremely risky, and takes months even if you succeed.
                I wouldn't try it myself. My advice is to err on the side of safety:
                when someone offers you a decent deal, just take it and get on with
                building the company. Startups win or lose based on the quality
                of their product, not the quality of their funding deals.<br><br><b>6. Most investors are looking for
                  big hits.</b><br><br>Venture investors like companies that could go public. That's where
                the big returns are. They know the odds of any individual startup
                going public are small, but they want to invest in those that at
                least have a <i>chance</i> of going public.<br><br>Currently the way VCs seem to operate is to invest in
                a bunch of
                companies, most of which fail, and one of which is Google. Those
                few big wins compensate for losses on their other investments. What this
                means is that most VCs will only invest in you if you're a potential
                Google. They don't care about companies that are a safe bet to be
                acquired for $20 million. There needs to be a chance, however
                small, of the company becoming really big.<br><br>Angels are different in this respect. They're happy to
                invest in
                a company where the most likely outcome is a $20 million acquisition
                if they can do it at a low enough valuation. But of course they
                like companies that could go public too. So having an ambitious
                long-term plan pleases everyone.<br><br>If you take VC money, you have to mean it, because the structure
                of VC deals prevents early acquisitions. If you take VC money,
                they won't let you sell early.<br><br><b>7. VCs want to invest large amounts.</b><br><br>The fact that
                they're running investment funds makes VCs want to
                invest large amounts. A typical VC fund is now hundreds of millions
                of dollars. If $400 million has to be invested by 10 partners,
                they have to invest $40 million each. VCs usually sit on the boards
                of companies they fund. If the average deal size was $1 million,
                each partner would have to sit on 40 boards, which would not be
                fun. So they prefer bigger deals, where they can put a lot of money
                to work at once.<br><br>VCs don't regard you as a bargain if you don't need a lot of money.
                That may even make you less attractive, because it means their
                investment creates less of a barrier to entry for competitors.<br><br>Angels are in a different position
                because they're investing their
                own money. They're happy to invest small amounts&mdash;sometimes as
                little as $20,000&mdash;as long as the potential returns look good
                enough. So if you're doing something inexpensive, go to angels.<br><br><b>8. Valuations are
                  fiction.</b><br><br>VCs admit that valuations are an artifact. They decide how much
                money you need and how much of the company they want, and those two
                constraints yield a valuation.<br><br>Valuations increase as the size of the investment does. A company
                that an angel is willing to put $50,000 into at a valuation of a
                million can't take $6 million from VCs at that valuation. That
                would leave the founders less than a seventh of the company between
                them (since the option pool would also come out of that seventh).
                Most VCs wouldn't want that, which is why you never hear of deals
                where a VC invests $6 million at a premoney valuation of $1 million.<br><br>If valuations change
                depending on the amount invested, that shows
                how far they are from reflecting any kind of value of the company.<br><br>Since valuations are made up,
                founders shouldn't care too much about
                them. That's not the part to focus on. In fact, a high valuation
                can be a bad thing. If you take funding at a premoney valuation
                of $10 million, you won't be selling the company for 20. You'll
                have to sell for over 50 for the VCs to get even a 5x return, which
                is low to them. More likely they'll want you to hold out for 100.
                But needing to get a high price decreases the chance of getting
                bought at all; many companies can buy you for $10 million, but only
                a handful for 100. And since a startup is like a pass/fail course
                for the founders, what you want to optimize is your chance of a
                good outcome, not the percentage of the company you keep.<br><br>So why do founders chase high
                valuations? They're tricked by
                misplaced ambition. They feel they've achieved more if they get a
                higher valuation. They usually know other founders, and if they
                get a higher valuation they can say "mine is bigger than yours."
                But funding is not the real test. The real test is the final outcome
                for the founder, and getting too high a valuation may just make a
                good outcome less likely.<br><br>The one advantage of a high valuation is that you get less dilution.
                But there is another less sexy way to achieve that: just take less
                money.<br><br><b>9. Investors look for founders like the current stars.</b><br><br>Ten years ago
                investors were looking for the next Bill Gates. This
                was a mistake, because Microsoft was a very anomalous startup. They
                started almost as a contract programming operation, and the reason
                they became huge was that IBM happened to drop the PC standard in
                their lap.<br><br>Now all the VCs are looking for the next Larry and Sergey. This
                is a good trend, because Larry and Sergey are closer to the ideal
                startup founders.<br><br>Historically investors thought it was important for a founder to
                be an expert in business. So they were willing to fund teams of
                MBAs who planned to use the money to pay programmers to build their
                product for them. This is like funding Steve Ballmer in the hope
                that the programmer he'll hire is Bill Gates&mdash;kind of backward,
                as the events of the Bubble showed. Now most VCs know they should
                be funding technical guys. This is more pronounced among the very
                top funds; the lamer ones still want to fund MBAs.<br><br>If you're a hacker, it's good news that
                investors are looking for
                Larry and Sergey. The bad news is, the only investors who can do
                it right are the ones who knew them when they were a
                couple of CS grad students, not the confident media stars they are
                today. What investors still don't get is how clueless and tentative
                great founders can seem at the very beginning.<br><br><b>10. The contribution of investors tends to be
                  underestimated.</b><br><br>Investors do more for startups than give them money. They're helpful
                in doing deals and arranging introductions, and some of the smarter
                ones, particularly angels, can give good advice about the product.<br><br>In fact, I'd say what
                separates the great investors from the mediocre
                ones is the quality of their advice. Most investors give advice,
                but the top ones give <i>good</i> advice.<br><br>Whatever help investors give a startup tends to be
                underestimated.
                It's to everyone's advantage to let the world think the founders
                thought of everything. The goal of the investors is for the company
                to become valuable, and the company seems more valuable if it seems
                like all the good ideas came from within.<br><br>This trend is compounded by the obsession that the
                press has with
                founders. In a company founded by two people, 10% of the ideas
                might come from the first guy they hire. Arguably they've done a
                bad job of hiring otherwise. And yet this guy will be almost
                entirely overlooked by the press.<br><br>I say this as a founder: the contribution of founders is always
                overestimated. The danger here is that new founders, looking at
                existing founders, will think that they're supermen that one couldn't
                possibly equal oneself. Actually they have a hundred different
                types of support people just offscreen making the whole show possible.

                discover how timid most VCs are. They
                seem to be afraid of looking bad to their partners, and perhaps
                also to the limited partners&mdash;the people whose money they invest.<br><br>You can measure this fear
                in how much less risk VCs are willing to
                take. You can tell they won't make investments for their fund that
                they might be willing to make themselves as angels. Though it's
                not quite accurate to say that VCs are less willing to take risks.
                They're less willing to do things that might look bad. That's not
                the same thing.<br><br>For example, most VCs would be very reluctant to invest in a startup
                founded by a pair of 18 year old hackers, no matter how brilliant,
                because if the startup failed their partners could turn on them and
                say "What, you invested $x million of our money in a pair of 18
                year olds?" Whereas if a VC invested in a startup founded by
                three former banking executives in their 40s who planned to outsource
                their product development&mdash;which to my mind is actually a lot
                riskier than investing in a pair of really smart 18 year olds&mdash;he
                couldn't be faulted, if it failed, for making such an apparently
                prudent investment.<br><br>As a friend of mine said, "Most VCs can't do anything that would
                sound bad to the kind of doofuses who run pension funds." Angels
                can take greater risks because they don't have to answer to anyone.<br><br><b>12. Being turned down by
                  investors doesn't mean much.</b><br><br>Some founders are quite dejected when they get turned down by
                investors. They shouldn't take it so much to heart. To start with,
                investors are often wrong. It's hard to think of a successful
                startup that wasn't turned down by investors at some point. Lots
                of VCs rejected Google. So obviously the reaction of investors is
                not a very meaningful test.<br><br>Investors will often reject you for what seem to be superficial
                reasons. I read of one VC who
                <a href="http://ricksegal.typepad.com/pmv/2007/02/a_fatal_paper_c.html">turned
                  down</a> a startup simply because
                they'd given away so many little bits of stock that the deal required
                too many signatures to close.
                <font color=#777777>[<a href="guidetoinvestors.html#f4n">
                    <font color=#777777>4</font>
                  </a>]</font>
                The reason investors can get away
                with this is that they see so many deals. It doesn't matter if
                they underestimate you because of some surface imperfection, because
                the next best deal will be <a href="judgement.html">almost as good</a>.
                Imagine picking out
                apples at a grocery store. You grab one with a little bruise.
                Maybe it's just a surface bruise, but why even bother checking when
                there are so many other unbruised apples to choose from?<br><br>Investors would be the first to admit
                they're often wrong. So when
                you get rejected by investors, don't think "we suck," but instead
                ask "do we suck?" Rejection is a question, not an answer.<br><br><b>13. Investors are
                  emotional.</b><br><br>I've been surprised to discover how emotional investors can be.
                You'd expect them to be cold and calculating, or at least businesslike,
                but often they're not. I'm not sure if it's their position of power
                that makes them this way, or the large sums of money involved, but
                investment negotiations can easily turn personal. If you offend
                investors, they'll leave in a huff.<br><br>A while ago an eminent VC firm offered a series A round to a
                startup
                we'd seed funded. Then they heard a rival VC firm was also interested.
                They were so afraid that they'd be rejected in favor of this other
                firm that they gave the startup what's known as an "exploding
                termsheet." They had, I think, 24 hours to say yes or no, or the
                deal was off. Exploding termsheets are a somewhat dubious device,
                but not uncommon. What surprised me was their reaction when I
                called to talk about it. I asked if they'd still be interested in
                the startup if the rival VC didn't end up making an offer, and they
                said no. What rational basis could they have had for saying that?
                If they thought the startup was worth investing in, what difference
                should it make what some other VC thought? Surely it was their
                duty to their limited partners simply to invest in the best
                opportunities they found; they should be delighted if the other VC
                said no, because it would mean they'd overlooked a good opportunity.
                But of course there was no rational basis for their decision. They
                just couldn't stand the idea of taking this rival firm's rejects.<br><br>In this case the exploding
                termsheet was not (or not only) a tactic
                to pressure the startup. It was more like the high school trick
                of breaking up with someone before they can break up with you. In
                an <a href="startupfunding.html">earlier essay</a> I said that VCs were a lot like high school girls.
                A few VCs have joked about that characterization, but none have
                disputed it.<br><br><b>14. The negotiation never stops till the closing.</b><br><br>Most deals, for
                investment or acquisition, happen in two phases.
                There's an initial phase of negotiation about the big questions.
                If this succeeds you get a termsheet, so called because it outlines
                the key terms of a deal. A termsheet is not legally binding,
                but it is a definite step. It's supposed to mean that a
                deal is going to happen, once the lawyers work out all the details.
                In theory these details are minor ones; by definition all the
                important points are supposed to be covered in the termsheet.<br><br>Inexperience and wishful thinking
                combine to make founders feel
                that when they have a termsheet, they have a deal. They want there
                to be a deal; everyone acts like they have a deal; so there must
                be a deal. But there isn't and may not be for several months. A
                lot can change for a startup in several months. It's not uncommon
                for investors and acquirers to get buyer's remorse. So you have
                to keep pushing, keep selling, all the way to the close. Otherwise
                all the "minor" details left unspecified in the termsheet will be
                interpreted to your disadvantage. The other side may even break
                the deal; if they do that, they'll usually seize on some technicality
                or claim you misled them, rather than admitting they changed their
                minds.<br><br>It can be hard to keep the pressure on an investor or acquirer all
                the way to the closing, because the most effective pressure is
                competition from other investors or acquirers, and these tend to
                drop away when you get a termsheet. You should try to stay as close
                friends as you can with these rivals, but the most important thing
                is just to keep up the momentum in your startup. The investors or
                acquirers chose you because you seemed hot. Keep doing whatever
                made you seem hot. Keep releasing new features; keep getting new
                users; keep getting mentioned in the press and in blogs.<br><br><b>15. Investors like to
                  co-invest.</b><br><br>I've been surprised how willing investors are to split deals. You
                might think that if they found a good deal they'd want it all to
                themselves, but they seem positively eager to syndicate. This is
                understandable with angels; they invest on a smaller scale and don't
                like to have too much money tied up in any one deal. But VCs also
                share deals a lot. Why?<br><br>Partly I think this is an artifact of the rule I quoted earlier:
                after traffic, VCs care most what other VCs think. A deal that has
                multiple VCs interested in it is more likely to close, so of deals
                that close, more will have multiple investors.<br><br>There is one rational reason to want multiple VCs
                in a deal: Any
                investor who co-invests with you is one less investor who could
                fund a competitor. Apparently Kleiner and Sequoia didn't like
                splitting the Google deal, but it did at least have the advantage,
                from each one's point of view, that there probably wouldn't be a
                competitor funded by the other. Splitting deals thus has similar
                advantages to confusing paternity.<br><br>But I think the main reason VCs like splitting deals is the
                fear
                of looking bad. If another firm shares the deal, then in the event
                of failure it will seem to have been a prudent choice&mdash;a consensus
                decision, rather than just the whim of an individual partner.<br><br><b>16. Investors
                  collude.</b><br><br>Investing is not covered by antitrust law. At least, it better not
                be, because investors regularly do things that would be illegal
                otherwise. I know personally of cases where one investor has talked
                another out of making a competitive offer, using the promise of
                sharing future deals.<br><br>In principle investors are all competing for the same deals, but
                the spirit of cooperation is stronger than the spirit of competition.
                The reason, again, is that there are so many deals. Though a
                professional investor may have a closer relationship with a founder
                he invests in than with other investors, his relationship with the
                founder is only going to last a couple years, whereas his relationship
                with other firms will last his whole career. There isn't so much
                at stake in his interactions with other investors, but there will
                be a lot of them. Professional investors are constantly trading
                little favors.<br><br>Another reason investors stick together is to preserve the power
                of investors as a whole. So you will not, as of this writing, be
                able to get investors into an auction for your series A round.
                They'd rather lose the deal than establish a precedent of VCs
                competitively bidding against one another. An efficient startup
                funding market may be coming in the distant future; things tend to
                move in that direction; but it's certainly not here now.
                <!--
The best way to describe the situation might be to say that VCs
compete intramurally. --><br><br><b>17. Large-scale investors care about their portfolio, not any
                  individual company.</b><br><br>The reason startups work so well is that everyone with power also
                has equity. The only way any of them can succeed is if they all
                do. This makes everyone naturally pull in the same direction,
                subject to differences of opinion about tactics.<br><br>The problem is, larger scale investors don't
                have exactly the same
                motivation. Close, but not identical. They don't need any given
                startup to succeed, like founders do, just their portfolio as a
                whole to. So in borderline cases the rational thing for them to
                do is to sacrifice unpromising startups.<br><br>Large-scale investors tend to put startups in three
                categories:
                successes, failures, and the "living dead"&mdash;companies that are
                plugging along but don't seem likely in the immediate future to get
                bought or go public. To the founders, "living dead" sounds harsh.
                These companies may be far from failures by ordinary standards. But
                they might as well be from a venture investor's point of view, and
                they suck up just as much time and attention as the successes. So
                if such a company has two possible strategies, a conservative one
                that's slightly more likely to work in the end, or a risky one that
                within a short time will either yield a giant success or kill the
                company, VCs will push for the kill-or-cure option. To them the
                company is already a write-off. Better to have resolution, one way
                or the other, as soon as possible.<br><br>If a startup gets into real trouble, instead of trying to save
                it
                VCs may just sell it at a low price to another of their portfolio
                companies. Philip Greenspun said in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141"><i>Founders at
                    Work</i></a> that Ars Digita's VCs did this to them.<br><br><b>18. Investors have different risk
                  profiles from founders.</b><br><br>Most people would rather a 100% chance of $1 million than a 20%
                chance of $10 million. Investors are rich enough to be rational
                and prefer the latter. So they'll always tend to encourage founders
                to keep rolling the dice. If a company is doing well, investors
                will want founders to turn down most acquisition offers. And indeed,
                most startups that turn down acquisition offers ultimately do better.
                But it's still hair-raising for the founders, because they might
                end up with nothing. When someone's offering to buy you for a price
                at which your stock is worth $5 million, saying no is equivalent
                to having $5 million and betting it all on one spin of the roulette
                wheel.<br><br>Investors will tell you the company is worth more. And they may
                be right. But that doesn't mean it's wrong to sell. Any financial
                advisor who put all his client's assets in the stock of a single,
                private company would probably lose his license for it.<br><br>More and more, investors are letting
                founders cash out partially.
                That should correct the problem. Most founders have such low standards
                that they'll feel rich with a sum that doesn't seem huge to investors.
                But this custom is spreading too slowly, because VCs are afraid of
                seeming irresponsible. No one wants to be the first VC to give
                someone fuck-you money and then actually get told "fuck you." But
                until this does start to happen, we know VCs are being too conservative.<br><br><b>19. Investors vary
                  greatly.</b><br><br>Back when I was a founder I used to think all VCs were the same.
                And in fact they do all <a href="http://www.redpoint.com/team/">look</a>
                the same. They're all what hackers
                call "suits." But since I've been dealing with VCs more I've learned
                that some suits are smarter than others.<br><br>They're also in a business where winners tend to keep
                winning and
                losers to keep losing. When a VC firm has been successful in the
                past, everyone wants funding from them, so they get the pick of all
                the new deals. The self-reinforcing nature of the venture funding
                market means that the top ten firms live in a completely different
                world from, say, the hundredth. As well as being smarter, they
                tend to be calmer and more upstanding; they don't need to do iffy
                things to get an edge, and don't want to because they have more
                brand to protect.<br><br>There are only two kinds of VCs you want to take money from, if you
                have the luxury of choosing: the "top tier" VCs, meaning about the
                top 20 or so firms, plus a few new ones that are not among the top
                20 only because they haven't been around long enough.<br><br>It's particularly important to raise money
                from a top firm if you're
                a hacker, because they're more confident. That means they're less
                likely to stick you with a business guy as CEO, like VCs used to
                do in the 90s. If you seem smart and want to do it, they'll let
                you run the company.<br><br><b>20. Investors don't realize how much it costs to raise money from
                  them.</b><br><br>Raising money is a huge time suck at just the point where startups
                can least afford it. It's not unusual for it to take five or six
                months to close a funding round. Six weeks is fast. And raising
                money is not just something you can leave running as a background
                process. When you're raising money, it's inevitably the main focus
                of the company. Which means building the product isn't.<br><br>Suppose a Y Combinator company starts
                talking to VCs after demo
                day, and is successful in raising money from them, closing the deal
                after a comparatively short 8 weeks. Since demo day occurs after
                10 weeks, the company is now 18 weeks old. Raising money, rather
                than working on the product, has been the company's main focus for
                44% of its existence. And mind you, this an example where things
                turned out <i>well</i>.<br><br>When a startup does return to working on the product after a funding
                round finally closes, it's as if they were returning to work after
                a months-long illness. They've lost most of their momentum.<br><br>Investors have no idea how much they
                damage the companies they
                invest in by taking so long to do it. But companies do. So there
                is a big opportunity here for a new kind of venture fund that invests
                smaller amounts at lower valuations, but promises to either close
                or say no very quickly. If there were such a firm, I'd recommend
                it to startups in preference to any other, no matter how prestigious.
                Startups live on speed and momentum.<br><br><b>21. Investors don't like to say no.</b><br><br>The reason
                funding deals take so long to close is mainly that
                investors can't make up their minds. VCs are not big companies;
                they can do a deal in 24 hours if they need to. But they usually
                let the initial meetings stretch out over a couple weeks. The
                reason is the selection algorithm I mentioned earlier. Most don't
                try to predict whether a startup will win, but to notice quickly
                that it already is winning. They care what the market thinks of
                you and what other VCs think of you, and they can't judge those
                just from meeting you.<br><br>Because they're investing in things that (a) change fast and (b)
                they don't understand, a lot of investors will reject you in a way
                that can later be claimed not to have been a rejection. Unless you
                know this world, you may not even realize you've been rejected.
                Here's a VC saying no:
                <blockquote>
                  We're really excited about your project, and we want to keep in
                  close touch as you develop it further.
                </blockquote>
                Translated into more straightforward language, this means: We're
                not investing in you, but we may change our minds if it looks like
                you're taking off. Sometimes they're more candid and say explicitly
                that they need to "see some traction." They'll invest in you if
                you start to get lots of users. But so would any VC. So all they're
                saying is that you're still at square 1.<br><br>Here's a test for deciding whether a VC's response was
                yes or no.
                Look down at your hands. Are you holding a termsheet?<br><br><b>22. You need investors.</b><br><br>Some
                founders say "Who needs investors?" Empirically the answer
                seems to be: everyone who wants to succeed. Practically every
                successful startup takes outside investment at some point.<br><br>Why? What the people who think they
                don't need investors forget is
                that they will have competitors. The question is not whether you
                <i>need</i> outside investment, but whether it could help you at all.
                If the answer is yes, and you don't take investment, then competitors
                who do will have an advantage over you. And in the startup world
                a little advantage can expand into a lot.<br><br>Mike Moritz famously said that he invested in Yahoo
                because he
                thought they had a few weeks' lead over their competitors. That
                may not have mattered quite so much as he thought, because Google
                came along three years later and kicked Yahoo's ass. But there is
                something in what he said. Sometimes a small lead can grow into
                the yes half of a binary choice.<br><br>Maybe as it gets cheaper to start a startup, it will start to be
                possible to succeed in a competitive market without outside funding.
                There are certainly
                costs to raising money. But as of this writing the empirical
                evidence says it's a net win.<br><br><b>23. Investors like it when you don't need them.</b><br><br>A lot
                of founders approach investors as if they needed their
                permission to start a company&mdash;as if it were like getting into
                college. But you don't need investors to start most companies;
                they just make it easier.<br><br>And in fact, investors greatly prefer it if you don't need them.
                What excites them, both consciously and unconsciously, is the sort
                of startup that approaches them saying "the train's leaving the
                station; are you in or out?" not the one saying "please can we have
                some money to start a company?"<br><br>Most investors are "bottoms" in the sense that the startups they
                like most are those that are rough with them. When Google stuck
                Kleiner and Sequoia with a $75 million premoney valuation, their
                reaction was probably "Ouch! That feels so good." And they were
                right, weren't they? That deal probably made them more than any
                other they've done.<br><br>The thing is, VCs are pretty good at reading people. So don't try
                to act tough with them unless you really are the next Google, or
                they'll see through you in a second. Instead of acting tough, what
                most startups should do is simply always have a backup plan. Always
                have some alternative plan for getting started if any given investor
                says no. Having one is the best insurance against needing one.<br><br>So you shouldn't start a startup
                that's expensive to start, because
                then you'll be at the mercy of investors. If you ultimately want
                to do something that will cost a lot, start by doing a cheaper
                subset of it, and expand your ambitions when and if you raise more
                money.<br><br>Apparently the most likely animals to be left alive after a nuclear
                war are cockroaches, because they're so hard to kill. That's what
                you want to be as a startup, initially. Instead of a beautiful
                but fragile flower that needs to have its stem in a plastic tube
                to support itself, better to be small, ugly, and
                indestructible.<br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n">
                  <font color=#000000>1</font>
                </a>]
                I may be underestimating VCs. They may play some behind the scenes
                role in IPOs, which you ultimately need if you want to create a silicon
                valley.<br><br>[<a name="f2n">
                  <font color=#000000>2</font>
                </a>]
                A few VCs have an email address you can send your business
                plan to, but the number of startups that get funded this way is
                basically zero. You should always get a personal introduction&mdash;and
                to a partner, not an associate.<br><br>[<a name="f3n">
                  <font color=#000000>3</font>
                </a>]
                Several people have told us that the most valuable thing about
                <a href="http://startupschool.org">startup school</a>
                was that they got to see famous startup founders and realized
                they were just ordinary guys. Though we're happy to provide this
                service, this is not generally the way we pitch startup school to
                potential speakers.<br><br>[<a name="f4n">

                Actually this sounds to me like a VC who got buyer's remorse,
                then used a technicality to get out of the deal. But it's telling
                that it even seemed a plausible excuse.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Sam Altman, Paul Buchheit, Hutch
