                <!--At the end of each day I save a copy of whatever I'm working on.
I thought it would be interesting to compare a finished
essay with the first version to see how much of the original  
text survives.

                As E. B. White said, "good writing is rewriting." I
                didn't
                realize this when I was in school. In writing, as in
                math and
                science, they only show you the finished product.
                You don't see all the false starts. This gives students
                a
                misleading view of how things get made.<br><br>Part of
                the reason it happens is that writers don't want
                people to see their mistakes. But I'm willing to let
                people
                see an early draft if it will show how much you have
                to rewrite to beat an essay into shape.<br><br>Below is
                the oldest version I can find of
                <a href="essay.html">The Age of the Essay</a>
                (probably the second or third day), with
                text that ultimately survived in
                <font color=#aa0000>red</font> and text that later
                got deleted in <font color=#777777>gray</font>.
                There seem to be several categories of cuts: things I
                got wrong,
                things that seem like bragging, flames,
                digressions, stretches of awkward prose, and unnecessary
                words.<br><br>I discarded more from the beginning.
                That's
                not surprising; it takes a while to hit your stride.
                There
                are more digressions at the start, because I'm not sure
                where
                I'm heading.<br><br>The amount of cutting is about
                average. I probably write
                three to four words for every one that appears in the
                final
                version of an essay.<br><br>(Before anyone gets mad at
                me for opinions expressed here, remember
                that anything you see here that's not in the final
                version is obviously
                something I chose not to publish, often because I
                disagree
                with it.)<br><br><br><br>
                <font color=#777777>
                        Recently a friend said that what he liked about
                        my essays was that they weren't written the way
                        we'd been taught to write essays in school. You
                        remember: <font color=#aa0000>topic sentence,
                                introductory paragraph,
                                supporting paragraphs, conclusion.
                        </font> It hadn't
                        occurred to me till then that those horrible
                        things
                        we had to write in school were even connected to
                        what I was doing now. But sure enough, I
                        thought,
                        they did call them "essays," didn't
                        they?<br><br>Well, they're not. Those things you
                        have to write
                        in school are not only not essays, they're one
                        of the
                        most pointless of all the pointless hoops you
                        have
                        to jump through in school. And I worry that they
                        not only teach students the wrong things about
                        writing,
                        but put them off writing entirely.<br><br>
                        <font color=#aa0000>So I'm going to give the
                                other side of the story: what
                                an essay really is, and how you write
                                one. Or at least,
                                how I write one.</font> Students be
                        forewarned: if you actually write
                        the kind of essay I describe, you'll probably
                        get bad
                        grades. But knowing how it's really done should
                        at least help you to understand the feeling of
                        futility
                        you have when you're writing the things they
                        tell you to.<br><br>
                        <font color=#aa0000>
                                The most obvious difference between real
                                essays and
                                the things one has to write in school is
                                that real
                                essays are not exclusively about English
                                literature.</font>
                        It's a fine thing for schools to
                        <font color=#aa0000>
                                teach students how to
                                write.</font> But for some bizarre
                        reason (actually, a very specific bizarre
                        reason that I'll explain in a moment),
                        <font color=#aa0000>
                                the teaching of
                                writing has gotten mixed together with
                                the study
                                of literature. And so all over the
                                country, students are
                                writing not about how a baseball team
                                with a small budget
                                might compete with the Yankees, or the
                                role of color in
                                fashion, or what constitutes a good
                                dessert, but about
                                symbolism in Dickens.</font><br><br>
                        <font color=#aa0000>With</font> obvious
                        <font color=#aa0000>result</font>s. Only a few
                        people really
                        <font color=#aa0000>
                                care about
                                symbolism in Dickens.</font> The teacher
                        doesn't.
                        The students don't. Most of the people who've
                        had to write PhD
                        disserations about Dickens don't. And certainly
                        <font color=#aa0000>
                                Dickens himself would be more interested
                                in an essay
                                about color or baseball.<br><br>How did
                                things get this way? To answer that we
                                have to go back
                                almost a thousand years.</font> Between
                        about 500 and 1000, life was
                        not very good in Europe. The term "dark ages" is
                        presently
                        out of fashion as too judgemental (the period
                        wasn't dark;
                        it was just <i>different</i>), but if this label
                        didn't already
                        exist, it would seem an inspired metaphor. What
                        little
                        original thought there was took place in lulls
                        between
                        constant wars and had something of the character
                        of
                        the thoughts of parents with a new baby.
                        The most amusing thing written during this
                        period, Liudprand of Cremona's Embassy to
                        Constantinople, is,
                        I suspect, mostly inadvertantly
                        so.<br><br>Around 1000 <font color=#aa0000>
                                Europe began to catch its breath.
                                And once they
                                had the luxury of curiosity,</font> one
                        of the first things they discovered
                        was <font color=#aa0000>what we call "the
                                classics."</font>
                        Imagine if <font color=#aa0000>we were visited
                                by</font> aliens. If they could even get
                        here they'd presumably know a
                        few things we don't. Immediately Alien Studies
                        would become
                        the most dynamic field of scholarship: instead
                        of painstakingly
                        discovering things for ourselves, we could
                        simply suck up
                        everything they'd discovered. So it was in
                        Europe in 1200.
                        When classical texts began to circulate in
                        Europe, they contained
                        not just new answers, but new questions. (If
                        anyone proved
                        a theorem in christian Europe before 1200, for
                        example, there
                        is no record of it.)<br><br>For a couple
                        centuries, some of the most important work
                        being done was intellectual archaelogy. Those
                        were also
                        the centuries during which schools were first
                        established.
                        And since reading ancient texts was the <font color=#aa0000>essence of what
                                scholars did</font> then, it became the
                        basis of the curriculum.<br><br>By 1700, <font color=#aa0000>someone who wanted to
                                learn about</font>
                        physics didn't need to start by mastering Greek
                        in order to read <font color=#aa0000>Aristotle.
                                But schools
                                change slower than scholarship</font>:
                        <font color=#aa0000>the study of
                                ancient texts</font>
                        had such prestige that it remained <font color=#aa0000>the backbone of</font>
                        education
                        until the late 19th century. By then it was
                        merely a tradition.
                        It did serve some purposes: reading a foreign
                        language was difficult,
                        and thus taught discipline, or at least, kept
                        students busy;
                        it introduced students to
                        cultures quite different from their own; and its
                        very uselessness
                        made it function (like white gloves) as a social
                        bulwark.
                        But it certainly wasn't
                        true, and hadn't been true for centuries, that
                        students were
                        serving apprenticeships in the hottest area of
                        scholarship.<br><br>Classical scholarship had
                        also changed. In the early era, philology
                        actually mattered. The texts that filtered into
                        Europe were
                        all corrupted to some degree by the errors of
                        translators and
                        copyists. Scholars had to figure out what
                        Aristotle said
                        before they could figure out what he meant. But
                        by the modern
                        era such questions were answered as well as they
                        were ever
                        going to be. And so the study of ancient texts
                        became less
                        about ancientness and more about texts.<br><br>
                        <font color=#aa0000>The time was then ripe for
                                the question: if the study of
                                ancient texts is a valid field for
                                scholarship, why not modern
                                texts? The answer, of course, is that
                                the raison d'etre
                                of classical scholarship was a kind of
                                intellectual archaelogy that
                                does not need to be done in the case of
                                contemporary authors.
                                But for obvious reasons no one wanted to
                                give that answer.
                                The archaeological work being mostly
                                done, it implied that
                                the people studying the classics were,
                                if not wasting their
                                time, at least working on problems of
                                minor importance.<br><br>And so began
                                the study of modern literature. There
                                was</font> some
                        initial <font color=#aa0000>resistance</font>,
                        but it didn't last long.
                        The limiting
                        reagent in the growth of university departments
                        is what
                        parents will let undergraduates study. If
                        parents will let
                        their children major in x, the rest follows
                        straightforwardly.
                        There will be jobs teaching x, and professors to
                        fill them.
                        The professors will establish scholarly journals
                        and publish
                        one another's papers. Universities with x
                        departments will
                        subscribe to the journals. Graduate students who
                        want jobs
                        as professors of x will write dissertations
                        about it. It may
                        take a good long while for the more prestigious
                        universities
                        to cave in and establish departments in cheesier
                        xes, but
                        at the other end of the scale there are so many
                        universities
                        competing to attract students that the mere
                        establishment of
                        a discipline requires little more than the
                        desire to do it.<br><br>

                        And so once university
                        English departments were established in the late
                        nineteenth century,

                                With the bizarre consequence that high
                                school students now
                                had to write about English literature--
                                to write, without
                                even realizing it, imitations of
                                whatever
                                English professors had been publishing
                                in their journals a
                                few decades before. It's no wonder if
                                this seems to the
                                student a pointless exercise, because
                                we're now three steps
                                removed from real work: the students are
                                imitating English
                                professors, who are imitating classical
                                scholars, who are
                                merely the inheritors of a tradition
                                growing out of what
                                was, 700 years ago, fascinating and
                                urgently needed work.</font>
                        <br><br>Perhaps high schools should drop English
                        and just teach writing.
                        The valuable part of English classes is learning
                        to write, and
                        that could be taught better by itself. Students
                        learn better
                        when they're interested in what they're doing,
                        and it's hard
                        to imagine a topic less interesting than
                        symbolism in Dickens.
                        Most of the people who write about that sort of
                        thing professionally
                        are not really interested in it. (Though indeed,
                        it's been a
                        while since they were writing about symbolism;
                        now they're
                        writing about gender.)<br><br>I have no
                        illusions about how eagerly this suggestion will
                        be adopted. Public schools probably couldn't
                        stop teaching
                        English even if they wanted to; they're probably
                        required to by
                        law. But here's a related suggestion that goes
                        with the grain
                        instead of against it: that universities
                        establish a
                        writing major. Many of the students who now
                        major in English
                        would major in writing if they could, and most
                        would
                        be better off.<br><br>It will be argued that it
                        is a good thing for students to be
                        exposed to their literary heritage. Certainly.
                        But is that
                        more important than that they learn to write
                        well? And are
                        English classes even the place to do it? After
                        all,
                        the average public high school student gets zero
                        exposure to
                        his artistic heritage. No disaster results.
                        The people who are interested in art learn about
                        it for
                        themselves, and those who aren't don't. I find
                        that American
                        adults are no better or worse informed about
                        literature than
                        art, despite the fact that they spent years
                        studying literature
                        in high school and no time at all studying art.
                        Which presumably
                        means that what they're taught in school is
                        rounding error
                        compared to what they pick up on their
                        own.<br><br>Indeed, English classes may even be
                        harmful. In my case they
                        were effectively aversion therapy. Want to make
                        someone dislike
                        a book? Force him to read it and write an essay
                        about it.
                        And make the topic so intellectually bogus that
                        you
                        could not, if asked, explain why one ought to
                        write about it.
                        I love to read more than anything, but by the
                        end of high school
                        I never read the books we were assigned. I was
                        so disgusted with
                        what we were doing that it became a point of
                        honor
                        with me to write nonsense at least as good at
                        the other students'
                        without having more than glanced over the book
                        to learn the names
                        of the characters and a few random events in
                        it.<br><br>I hoped this might be fixed in
                        college, but I found the same
                        problem there. It was not the teachers. It was
                        English.
                        We were supposed to read novels and write essays
                        about them.
                        About what, and why? That no one seemed to be
                        able to explain.
                        Eventually by trial and error I found that what
                        the teacher
                        wanted us to do was pretend that the story had
                        really taken
                        place, and to analyze based on what the
                        characters said and did (the
                        subtler clues, the better) what their motives
                        must have been.
                        One got extra credit for motives having to do
                        with class,
                        as I suspect one must now for those involving
                        gender and
                        sexuality. I learned how to churn out such stuff
                        well enough
                        to get an A, but I never took another English
                        class.<br><br>And the books we did these
                        disgusting things to, like those
                        we mishandled in high school, I find still have
                        black marks
                        against them in my mind. The one saving grace
                        was that
                        English courses tend to favor pompous, dull
                        writers like
                        Henry James, who deserve black marks against
                        their names anyway.
                        One of the principles the IRS uses in deciding
                        whether to
                        allow deductions is that, if something is fun,
                        it isn't work.
                        Fields that are intellectually unsure of
                        themselves rely on
                        a similar principle. Reading P.G. Wodehouse or
                        Evelyn Waugh or
                        Raymond Chandler is too obviously pleasing to
                        seem like
                        serious work, as reading Shakespeare would have
                        been before
                        English evolved enough to make it an effort to
                        understand him. [sh]
                        And so good writers (just you wait and see who's
                        still in
                        print in 300 years) are less likely to have
                        readers turned
                        against them by clumsy, self-appointed tour
                        guides.<br><br>
                        <font color=#aa0000>The other big difference
                                between a real essay and the

                                they make you write in school is that a
                                real essay doesn't
                                take a position and then defend it. That

                                like the idea that we ought to be

                                medieval universities were mostly

                                were more law schools. And at least in

                                and dissertation as interchangeable, but
                                originally, at least,
                                a thesis was a position one took and the
                                dissertation was
                                the argument by which one defended it.

                        original
                        sense of the word thesis, the better. For many,

                        graduate students, it is stuffing a square peg
                        into a round
                        hole to try to recast one's work as a single
                        thesis. And
                        as for the disputation, that seems clearly a net

                                And yet this principle is built into the
                                very structure of
                                the</font> essays

                                advance, the supporting

                                conclusion- — uh, what it the
                                conclusion? I was never sure
                                about that in high school.</font> If
                        your thesis was well expressed,
                        what need was there to restate it? In theory it
                        seemed that
                        the conclusion of a really good essay ought not
                        to need to
                        say any more than QED.
                        <font color=#aa0000>But when you understand the
                                origins
                                of this sort of "essay", you can see
                                where the
                                conclusion comes from. It's the

                        What other alternative is there? To answer that
                        <font color=#aa0000>we have to
                                reach back into history again, though
                                this time not so far.

                        <font color=#aa0000>lawyer do</font>es,

                                Essayer is the French
                                verb meaning "to try"</font> (the cousin
                        of our word assay),

                                and an "essai" is an</font> effort.
                        <font color=#aa0000>An essay is something you
                                write</font> in order
                        <font color=#aa0000>to figure something
                                out.<br><br>Figure out what? You don't
                                know yet. And so you can't begin with a
                                thesis, because you don't have one, and
                                may never have
                                one. An essay doesn't begin with a
                                statement, but with a
                                question. In a real essay, you don't
                                take a position and
                                defend it. You see a door that's ajar,
                                and you open it and
                                walk in to see what's inside.<br><br>If
                                all you want to do is figure things out,
                                why do you need
                                to write anything, though? Why not just
                                sit and think? Well,
                                there precisely is Montaigne's great
                                discovery. Expressing
                                ideas helps to form them. Indeed, helps
                                is far too weak a

                        <font color=#aa0000>I only
                                thought of when I sat down to write
                                them. That's why I
                                write them.</font><br><br>So there's
                        another difference between essays and
                        <font color=#aa0000>the things
                                you have to write in school</font>. In
                        school
                        <font color=#aa0000>
                                you are, in theory,
                                explaining yourself to</font> someone
                        else. In the best case---if
                        you're really organized---you're just writing it
                        <i>down.</i>
                        <font color=#aa0000>In a real essay you're
                                writing for yourself. You're
                                thinking out loud.<br><br>But not quite.
                                Just as inviting people over forces you
                                to
                                clean up your apartment, writing
                                something that</font> you know
                        <font color=#aa0000>

                                think well. So it
                                does matter to have an audience. The
                                things I've written
                                just for myself are no good.</font>
                        Indeed, they're bad in
                        a particular way:
                        <font color=#aa0000>they tend to peter out. When
                                I run into
                                difficulties, I</font> notice that I
                        <font color=#aa0000>tend to conclude with a few
                                vague
                                questions and then drift off to get a
                                cup of tea.</font><br><br>This seems a
                        common problem.
                        It's practically the standard
                        ending in blog entries- — with the addition of a
                        "heh" or an
                        emoticon, prompted by the all too accurate sense
                        that
                        something is missing.<br><br>And indeed, a lot

                                Particularly the sort written by the
                                staff writers of newsmagazines. Outside
                                writers tend to supply
                                editorials of the defend-a-position
                                variety, which
                                make a beeline toward a rousing (and
                                foreordained) conclusion. But the staff
                                writers feel
                                obliged to write something</font> more
                        <font color=#aa0000>balanced</font>, which in
                        practice ends up meaning blurry.

                        <font color=#aa0000>they then proceed to recoil

                                another. One thing is certain: the
                                question is a
                                complex one. (But don't get mad at us.
                                We didn't

                                aren't enough. An essay has to come up
                                with answers.
                                They don't always, of course. Sometimes
                                you start with a
                                promising question and get nowhere. But
                                those you don't
                                publish. Those are like experiments that
                                get inconclusive
                                results. Something you publish ought to
                                tell the reader
                                something he didn't already
                                know.<br><br>
                                But <i>what</i> you tell him doesn't
                                matter, so long as
                                it's interesting. I'm sometimes accused
                                of meandering.
                                In defend-a-position writing that would
                                be a flaw.
                                There you're not concerned with truth.
                                You already
                                know where you're going, and you want to
                                go straight there,
                                blustering through obstacles, and
                                hand-waving
                                your way across swampy ground. But
                                that's not what
                                you're trying to do in an essay. An
                                essay is supposed to
                                be a search for truth. It would be
                                suspicious if it didn't
                                meander.<br><br>The Meander is a river
                                in</font> Asia Minor (aka
                        <font color=#aa0000>Turkey</font>).
                        <font color=#aa0000>As you might expect, it
                                winds all over the place.
                                But</font> does it
                        <font color=#aa0000>do this out of frivolity
                        </font>? Quite the opposite.
                        Like all rivers, it's rigorously following the
                        laws of physics.
                        <font color=#aa0000>The path it has discovered
                        </font>,
                        winding as it is, represents
                        <font color=#aa0000>the most economical route to
                                the sea.<br><br>The river's algorithm is
                                simple. At each step, flow down.
                                For the essayist this translates to:
                                flow interesting.
                                Of all the places to go next, choose
                        </font>
                        whichever seems
                        <font color=#aa0000>most interesting.</font>
                        <br><br>I'm pushing this metaphor a bit. An
                        essayist
                        <font color=#aa0000>can't have
                                quite as little foresight as a river.
                        </font> In fact what you do
                        (or what I do) is somewhere between a river and
                        a roman
                        road-builder. I have a general idea of the
                        direction
                        I want to go in, and
                        I choose the next topic with that in mind. This
                        essay is
                        about writing, so I do occasionally yank it back
                        in that
                        direction, but it is not all the sort of essay I
                        thought I was going to write about
                        writing.<br><br>Note too that hill-climbing

                        <font color=#aa0000>like a river,</font>
                        you

                        <font color=#aa0000>what the river does:

                                At one point in this essay
                                I found that after following a certain
                                thread I ran out
                                of ideas. I had to go back</font> n
                        <font color=#aa0000>paragraphs and start over
                                in another direction.</font> For
                        illustrative purposes I've left
                        the abandoned branch as a footnote.<br><br>

                                Err on the side of the river. An essay
                                is not a reference
                                work. It's not something you read
                                looking for a specific
                                answer, and feel cheated if you don't
                                find it. I'd much
                                rather read an essay that went off in an
                                unexpected but
                                interesting direction than one that
                                plodded dutifully along
                                a prescribed course.<br><br>So what's
                                interesting? For me, interesting means
                                surprise.
                                Design, as </font>Matz
                        <font color=#aa0000>has said, should follow the
                                principle of
                                least</font> surprise.
                        <font color=#aa0000>A button that looks like it
                                will make a

                                speed up. Essays
                                should do the opposite. Essays should
                                aim for maximum
                                surprise.<br><br>I was afraid of flying
                                for a long time and could only travel
                                vicariously. When friends came back from
                                faraway places,
                                it wasn't just out of politeness that I
                                asked them</font> about
                        their trip.
                        <font color=#aa0000>I really wanted to know. And
                                I found</font> that
                        <font color=#aa0000>the best way to get
                                information out of them was to ask
                                what surprised them. How was the place
                                different from what
                                they expected? This is an extremely
                                useful question.
                                You can ask it of</font> even
                        <font color=#aa0000>the most unobservant people,
                                and it will
                                extract information they didn't even
                                know they were
                                recording. </font><br><br>Indeed, you
                        can ask it in real time. Now when I go somewhere
                        new, I make a note of what surprises me about
                        it. Sometimes I
                        even make a conscious effort to visualize the
                        place beforehand,
                        so I'll have a detailed image to diff with
                        reality.<br><br>
                        <font color=#aa0000>
                                Surprises are</font> facts
                        <font color=#aa0000>you didn't</font> already
                        <font color=#aa0000>know</font>.
                        <font color=#aa0000>But</font> they're
                        more than that. They're facts
                        <font color=#aa0000>that contradict things you
                                thought you knew. And so they're the
                                most valuable sort of
                                fact you can get. They're like a food
                                that's not merely
                                healthy, but counteracts the unhealthy
                                effects of things
                                you've already eaten.<br><br>
                                How do you find surprises? Well, therein
                                lies half
                                the work of essay writing. (The other
                                half is expressing
                                yourself well.)</font> You can at least
                        <font color=#aa0000>use yourself as a
                                proxy for the reader. You should only
                                write about things
                                you've thought about a lot. And anything
                                you come across
                                that surprises you, who've thought about
                                the topic a lot,
                                will probably surprise most
                                readers.<br><br>For example, in a recent
                                essay I pointed out that because
                                you can only judge computer programmers
                                by working with
                                them, no one knows</font> in programming
                        who the heroes should
                        be.

                        certainly
                        <font color=#aa0000>didn't realize this when I
                        </font> started writing
                        the
                        <font color=#aa0000>essay, and even now I find
                                it kind of weird. That's
                                what you're looking for.<br><br>So if
                                you want to write essays, you need two

                        you need
                        <font color=#aa0000>a few topics that you think
                                about a lot, and</font> you
                        need <font color=#aa0000>some ability to ferret
                                out the unexpected.<br><br>What should
                                you think about? My guess is that it
                                doesn't matter</font>. Almost everything
                        is
                        <font color=#aa0000>interesting if you get
                                deeply
                                enough into it.</font> The <font color=#aa0000>one possible exception
                        </font>
                        are
                        <font color=#aa0000>things
                                like working in fast food,</font> which
                        <font color=#aa0000>have deliberately had all
                                the variation sucked out of them</font>.
                        <font color=#aa0000>In retrospect, was there
                                anything interesting about working in
                                Baskin-Robbins?
                                Well, it was interesting</font> to
                        notice
                        <font color=#aa0000>how important color was
                                to the customers. Kids a certain age
                                would point into
                                the case and say that they wanted
                                yellow. Did they want
                                French Vanilla or Lemon? They would just
                                look at you
                                blankly. They wanted yellow. And then
                                there was the
                                mystery of why the perennial favorite
                                Pralines n' Cream
                                was so appealing. I</font>'m inclined
                        now to
                        <font color=#aa0000>think it was the salt.
                        </font>
                        And the mystery of why Passion Fruit tasted so
                        disgusting.
                        People would order it because of the name, and
                        were always
                        disappointed. It should have been called
                        In-sink-erator
                        Fruit.
                        <font color=#aa0000>And</font> there was
                        <font color=#aa0000>the difference in the way
                                fathers and
                                mothers bought ice cream for their kids
                        </font>.
                        <font color=#aa0000>Fathers</font> tended to
                        adopt the attitude of
                        <font color=#aa0000>benevolent kings bestowing
                                largesse,</font>
                        and <font color=#aa0000>mothers</font> that of
                        <font color=#aa0000>harried</font> bureaucrats,
                        <font color=#aa0000>giving in to
                                pressure</font> against their better
                        judgement.
                        <font color=#aa0000>So, yes, there does seem to
                                be material, even in
                                fast food.</font><br><br>What about the
                        other half, ferreting out the unexpected?
                        That may require some natural ability. I've
                        noticed for
                        a long time that I'm pathologically observant.
                        ....<br><br>[That was as far as I'd gotten at

                        In Shakespeare's own time, serious writing meant
                        theological
                        discourses, not the bawdy plays acted over on
                        the other
                        side of the river among the bear gardens and
                        whorehouses.<br><br>The other extreme, the work
                        that seems formidable from the moment
                        it's created (indeed, is deliberately intended
                        to be)
                        is represented by Milton. Like the Aeneid,
                        Paradise Lost is a
                        rock imitating a butterfly that happened to get
                        fossilized.
                        Even Samuel Johnson seems to have balked at
                        this, on the one
                        hand paying Milton the compliment of an
                        extensive biography,
                        and on the other writing of Paradise Lost that
                        "none who read it
                        ever wished it longer."<br><br><br><br>

                                This is the part I had to discard when I
                                backtracked.
                                It used to follow the paragraph that
                                ended with
                                "prescribed course."</font>
                        <br><br>Because you're after answers, instead of
                        just trying to
                        convince people of something, it's important to
                        qualify
                        your conclusions precisely. No scientist will be
                        satisfied
                        to hear that you measured something and it was
                        12.7.
                        12.7 plus or minus what? What's your
                        experimental error?<br><br>This is just as
                        important for questions whose answers
                        aren't numbers.
                        And yet people rarely bother in ordinary
                        conversation, most scientists included. Once
                        people
                        switch over to talking about matters that aren't
                        "scientific"- — mere matters of opinion--- they
                        pay
                        comparatively little attention to qualifying
                        what they say.<br><br>Oh, they <i>use</i>
                        qualifiers. Once kids
                        arrive in college they learn pretty quickly that
                        proper
                        intellectuals qualify every statement with
                        "perhaps"
                        or "almost." But this kind of qualification is
                        nothing more
                        than grammatical. Sometimes these automatically
                        inserted
                        qualifications end up at odds with the
                        statements they're
                        attached to, yielding comic results.
                        You find people saying that a certain writer is
                        "perhaps the greatest writer of the twentieth
                        century."
                        That's a rather strong way to put something
                        you're not sure
                        about. Wouldn't it be better just to say "one of
                        the best
                        writers of the twentieth century?"<br><br>One of
                        the only people I've ever met who really pays
                        attention
                        to qualification is my friend Robert Morris. His
                        great
                        fear in life is to say something that's
                        mistaken. So whenever
                        he says something, he pays as much attention to
                        expressing
                        how sure he is of it as he does to what he's
                        saying. He
                        is a connoisseur of his own certainty, and has
                        as many words
                        for expressing it as Eskimos have for snow. This
                        is how we
                        all ought to be. Sticking a perfunctory perhaps
                        onto
                        every statement may shield us from blame, but it
                        tells the
                        reader nothing. That's like the manufacturers of
                        Q-Tips,
                        who to cover themselves print "do not insert in
                        ear canal" on the
                        boxes, when they know damned well that that's
                        how Q-Tips are used.<br><br>One of the most
                        important things to know about
                        painting is that darks make the light. This is
                        particularly
                        obvious in watercolor. Suppose you want to make
                        a painting
                        that seems glowing with light. Well, you can't
                        get any
                        brighter than the white of the paper. So the
                        only way to
                        make the make the painting bright is to add
                        darks
                        that make the lights seem brighter by contrast.
                        Without
                        darks, the painting won't seem bright; it will
                        just seem
                        washed out.<br><br>Some books about writing say
                        that you shouldn't begin
                        sentences with "I think." If you're saying
                        something,
                        the argument does, then obviously you think it,
                        so why
                        bother telling people? This is nonsense. The
                        heavily qualified
                        statements in an essay play the role of darks.
                        When you
                        reach a point you're really sure of, you can
                        just state it with no
                        qualifications, and it will have all the more
                        force by contrast.<br><br>People aren't used to
                        unqualified statements. Without the automatic
                        "perhaps"
                        they're used to seeing, many realize, with a
                        shock,
                        that what they're reading are <i>opinions.</i>
                        Well of course. And what essay consists of
                        anything else?
                        An essay is not a theorem.
                        You don't have to say only things you can prove
                        irrefutably.
                        Don't be afraid of expressing your opinions.
                        Just make sure
                        you're right.<br><br><br><br>

                        <br><br>The downside is that essays may contain
                        mistakes (though
                        so can theorems). The upside is that you can
                        talk about<br><br>more things.<br><br>The world
                        is not divided into the "scientific" and the
                        "subjective." Scientific is a matter of degree.
                        And there
                        are plenty of questions that would be
                        impractical to
                        answer by a controlled experiment and yet which
                        are
                        worth discussing. Indeed, some of the most
                        interesting
                        questions are of this type.<br><br>To
                        mathematicians, the work of physicists seems
                        rather
                        speculative.<br><br>But if they're less precise,
                        they can talk about a broader
                        range of subjects.<br><br>Sometimes I feel
                        tempted to
                        add a disclaimer to the beginning of my essays
                        saying,
                        if you're bothered by unqualified statements,
                        just stick
                        the "perhaps" that you're used to seeing before
                        each one.

                        was a
                        distant memory. But the classics still had
                        enormous prestige.
                        The problems posed by the ancientness part had
                        been mostly
                        solved, or solved as well as they were going to
