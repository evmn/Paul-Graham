    Done in 1999, I think.  I made this as an experiment: I wanted
to see if a painting much larger than life (the 
original is 2' x 2') would look especially sharp when reproduced.

    I was kicking myself
while I was working on it, because it ended up taking so long to
paint that large.  I had to spend several weeks 
looking at a boring, awkward still life I set up in 10 minutes.

    (No, it's not from a photograph.  I deliberately
made distant bits blurry to give an impression of depth.)
