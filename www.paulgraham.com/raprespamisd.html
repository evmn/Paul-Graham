   Most people talk about the cost of spam as just the time spent
 hitting the "d" key. However, there are two much darker
 consequences. First, people change their online behavior to make
 themselves less accessible by e-mail. For example, just in the last
 week I got two requests from people to take their email addresses off
 articles posted to Advogato. Many people believe that the purpose of
 email and the Internet in general is to foster more open
 communications. Spam makes it less so.

   Second, overagressive spam filters sometimes cause serious difficulties.
 Here is one recent example:

   </a>

   Entities like SpamCop would not be necessary if it weren't for the
 volume of spam, and they certainly wouldn't be able to shut people's
 websites down.
