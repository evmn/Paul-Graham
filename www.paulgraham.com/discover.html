              <article>September 2009<br><br>When meeting people you don't know very well, the convention is
                to seem extra friendly. You smile and say "pleased to meet you,"
                whether you are or not. There's nothing dishonest about this.
                Everyone knows that these little social lies aren't meant
                to be taken literally, just as everyone knows that
                "Can you pass the salt?" is only grammatically a question.<br><br>I'm perfectly willing to smile and say
                "pleased to meet you"
                when meeting new people. But there is another set of
                customs for being ingratiating in print that are not so
                harmless.<br><br>The reason there's a convention of being ingratiating in print
                is that most essays are written to persuade.
                And as any politician could tell
                you, the way to persuade people is not just to baldly state the
                facts. You have to add a spoonful of sugar to make the medicine
                go down.<br><br>For example, a politician announcing the cancellation of
                a government program will not merely say "The
                program is canceled." That would seem offensively
                curt. Instead he'll spend most of his time talking about the
                noble effort made by the people who worked on it.<br><br>The reason these conventions are more dangerous
                is that they
                interact with the ideas. Saying "pleased to meet you" is just
                something you prepend to a conversation, but the sort of spin
                added by politicians is woven through it. We're starting to
                move from social lies to real lies.<br><br>Here's an example of a paragraph from an essay I wrote about
                <a href="unions.html">labor unions</a>. As written,
                it tends to offend people who like unions.
                <blockquote>
                  People who think the labor movement was the creation of heroic
                  union organizers have a problem to explain: why are unions shrinking
                  now? The best they can do is fall back on the default explanation
                  of people living in fallen civilizations. Our ancestors were
                  giants. The workers of the early twentieth century must have had
                  a moral courage that's lacking today.
                </blockquote>
                Now here's the same paragraph rewritten to please instead of
                offending them:
                <blockquote>
                  Early union organizers made heroic sacrifices to improve conditions
                  for workers. But though
                  labor unions are shrinking now, it's not because present union
                  leaders are any less courageous. An employer couldn't get away
                  with hiring thugs to beat up union leaders today, but if they
                  did, I see no reason to believe today's union leaders would shrink
                  from the challenge. So I think it would be a mistake to attribute
                  the decline of unions to some kind of decline in the people who
                  run them. Early union leaders were heroic, certainly, but we
                  should not suppose that if unions have declined, it's because
                  present union leaders are somehow inferior. The cause must be
                  external.
                  <font color=#999999>[<a href="discover.html#f1n">
                      <font color=#999999>1</font>
                    </a>]</font>
                </blockquote>
                It makes the same point: that it can't have been the personal
                qualities of early union organizers that made unions successful,
                but must have been some external factor, or otherwise present-day
                union leaders would have to be inferior people. But written this
                way it seems like a defense of present-day union organizers rather
                than an attack on early ones. That makes it more persuasive to
                people who like unions, because it seems sympathetic to their cause.<br><br>I believe everything I wrote
                in the second version. Early union
                leaders did make heroic sacrifices. And
                present union leaders probably would rise to the occasion if
                necessary. People tend to; I'm skeptical about the idea of "the
                greatest generation."
                <font color=#999999>[<a href="discover.html#f2n">
                    <font color=#999999>2</font>
                  </a>]</font><br><br>If I believe everything I said in the second version, why didn't I
                write it that way? Why offend people needlessly?<br><br>Because I'd rather offend people than pander to
                them,
                and if you write about controversial topics you have to choose one or the other. The degree of
                courage of past or present union leaders is beside the point; all
                that matters for the argument is that they're the same.
                But if you want to please
                people who are mistaken, you can't simply tell the truth. You're
                always going to have to add some sort of padding to protect their
                misconceptions from bumping against reality.<br><br>Most writers do. Most writers write to persuade, if
                only out of
                habit or politeness. But I don't write to persuade; I write to
                figure out. I write to persuade a hypothetical perfectly unbiased
                reader.<br><br>Since the custom is to write to persuade the actual reader, someone
                who doesn't will seem arrogant. In fact, worse than arrogant: since
                readers are used to essays that try to please someone, an essay
                that displeases one side in a dispute reads as an attempt to pander
                to the other. To a lot of pro-union readers, the first paragraph
                sounds like the sort of thing a right-wing radio talk show host
                would say to stir up his followers. But it's not. Something that
                curtly contradicts one's beliefs can be hard to distinguish from a
                partisan attack on them, but though they can end up in the same
                place they come from different sources.<br><br>Would it be so bad to add a few extra words, to make
                people feel
                better? Maybe not. Maybe I'm excessively attached to conciseness.
                I write <a href="power.html">code</a> the same way I write essays,
                making pass after pass
                looking for anything I can cut. But I have a legitimate reason for
                doing this. You don't know what the ideas are until you get them
                down to the fewest words.
                <font color=#999999>[<a href="discover.html#f3n">
                    <font color=#999999>3</font>
                  </a>]</font><br><br>The danger of the second paragraph
                is not merely that it's longer. It's that you start to lie to
                yourself. The ideas start to get mixed together with the spin
                you've added to get them past the readers' misconceptions.<br><br>I think the goal of an essay should be
                to discover
                <a href="essay.html">surprising</a> things. That's my goal, at least.
                And most surprising means most different from what people currently
                believe. So writing to persuade and writing to discover are
                diametrically opposed. The more your conclusions disagree with
                readers' present beliefs, the more effort you'll have to expend on
                selling your ideas rather than having them. As you accelerate,
                this drag increases, till eventually you reach a point where 100%
                of your energy is devoted to overcoming it and you can't go any
                faster.<br><br>It's hard enough to overcome one's own misconceptions without having
                to think about how to get the resulting ideas past other people's.
                I worry that if I wrote to persuade, I'd start to shy away unconsciously
                from ideas I knew would be hard to sell. When I notice something
                surprising, it's usually very faint at first. There's nothing more
                than a slight stirring of discomfort. I don't want anything to get
                in the way of noticing it consciously.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>
                <b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n">

                </a>]
                I had a strange feeling of being back in high school writing
                this. To get a good grade you had to both write the sort of pious
                crap you were expected to, but also seem to be writing with conviction.
                The solution was a kind of method acting. It was revoltingly
                familiar to slip back into it.<br><br>[<a name="f2n">
                  <font color=#000000>2</font>
                </a>]
                Exercise for the reader:
                rephrase that thought to please the same people the first version
                would offend.<br><br>[<a name="f3n">
                  <font color=#000000>3</font>
                </a>]
                Come to think of it, there is one way in which I deliberately
                pander to readers, because it doesn't change the number of words:
                I switch person. This flattering distinction seems so natural to
                the average reader that they probably don't notice even when I
                switch in mid-sentence, though you tend to notice when it's done
                as conspicuously as this.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Jessica Livingston and Robert Morris
                for reading drafts of this.<br><br><b>Note:</b> An earlier version of this essay began by talking
                about why people dislike Michael Arrington. I now believe that
                was mistaken, and that most people don't dislike him for the
                same reason I did when I first met him, but simply because
                he writes about controversial things.<br><br>
