        <article>January 2003<br><br>
                <i>(This article is derived from a
                        keynote talk at the fall 2002 meeting
                        of NEPLS.)</i><br><br>Visitors to this country
                are often surprised to find that
                Americans like to begin a conversation by asking "what
                do you do?"
                I've never liked this question. I've rarely had a
                neat answer to it. But I think I have finally solved the
                problem.
                Now, when someone asks me what I do, I look them
                straight
                in the eye and say "I'm designing a
                <a href="arc.html">new dialect of Lisp</a>."
                I recommend this answer to anyone who doesn't like being
                asked what
                they do. The conversation will turn immediately to other
                topics.<br><br>I don't consider myself to be doing
                research on programming languages.
                I'm just designing one, in the same way that someone
                might design
                a building or a chair or a new typeface.
                I'm not trying to discover anything new. I just want
                to make a language that will be good to program in. In
                some ways,
                this assumption makes life a lot easier.<br><br>The
                difference between design and research seems to be a
                question
                of new versus good. Design doesn't have to be new, but
                it has to
                be good. Research doesn't have to be good, but it has to
                be new.
                I think these two paths converge at the top: the best
                design
                surpasses its predecessors by using new ideas, and the
                best research
                solves problems that are not only new, but actually
                worth solving.
                So ultimately we're aiming for the same destination,
                just approaching
                it from different directions.<br><br>What I'm going to
                talk about today is what your target looks like
                from the back. What do you do differently when you treat
                programming languages as a design problem instead of a
                research topic?<br><br><br><br>The biggest difference is
                that you focus more on the user.
                Design begins by asking, who is this
                for and what do they need from it? A good architect,
                for example, does not begin by creating a design that he
                then
                imposes on the users, but by studying the intended users
                and figuring
                out what they need.<br><br>Notice I said "what they
                need," not "what they want." I don't mean
                to give the impression that working as a designer means
                working as
                a sort of short-order cook, making whatever the client
                tells you
                to. This varies from field to field in the arts, but
                I don't think there is any field in which the best work
                is done by
                the people who just make exactly what the customers tell
                them to.<br><br>The customer <i>is</i> always right in
                the sense that the measure of good design is how well it
                works
                for the user. If you make a novel that bores everyone,
                or a chair
                that's horribly uncomfortable to sit in, then you've
                done a bad
                job, period. It's no defense to say that the novel or
                the chair
                is designed according to the most advanced theoretical
                principles.<br><br>And yet, making what works for the
                user doesn't mean simply making
                what the user tells you to. Users don't know what all
                the choices
                are, and are often mistaken about what they really
                want.<br><br>The answer to the paradox, I think, is that
                you have to design
                for the user, but you have to design what the user
                needs, not simply
                what he says he wants.
                It's much like being a doctor. You can't just treat a
                patient's
                symptoms. When a patient tells you his symptoms, you
                have to figure
                out what's actually wrong with him, and treat
                that.<br><br>This focus on the user is a kind of axiom
                from which most of the
                practice of good design can be derived, and around which
                most design
                issues center.<br><br><br><br>If good design must do
                what the user needs, who is the user? When
                I say that design must be for users, I don't mean to
                imply that good
                design aims at some kind of
                lowest common denominator. You can pick any group of
                users you
                want. If you're designing a tool, for example, you can
                design it
                for anyone from beginners to experts, and what's good
                design
                for one group might be bad for another. The point
                is, you have to pick some group of users. I don't think
                you can
                even talk about good or bad design except with
                reference to some intended user.<br><br>You're most
                likely to get good design if the intended users include
                the designer himself. When you design something
                for a group that doesn't include you, it tends to be for
                people
                you consider to be less sophisticated than you, not more
                sophisticated.<br><br>That's a problem, because looking
                down on the user, however benevolently,
                seems inevitably to corrupt the designer.
                I suspect that very few housing
                projects in the US were designed by architects who
                expected to live
                in them. You can see the same thing
                in programming languages. C, Lisp, and Smalltalk were
                created for
                their own designers to use. Cobol, Ada, and Java, were
                created
                for other people to use.<br><br>If you think you're
                designing something for idiots, the odds are
                that you're not designing something good, even for
                idiots.<br><br><br><br>
                Even if you're designing something for the most
                sophisticated
                users, though, you're still designing for humans. It's
                different
                in research. In math you
                don't choose abstractions because they're
                easy for humans to understand; you choose whichever make
                the
                proof shorter. I think this is true for the sciences
                generally.
                Scientific ideas are not meant to be
                ergonomic.<br><br>Over in the arts, things are very
                different. Design is
                all about people. The human body is a strange
                thing, but when you're designing a chair,
                that's what you're designing for, and there's no way
                around it.
                All the arts have to pander to the interests and
                limitations
                of humans. In painting, for example, all other things
                being
                equal a painting with people in it will be more
                interesting than
                one without. It is not merely an accident of history
                that
                the great paintings of the Renaissance are all full of
                people.
                If they hadn't been, painting as a medium wouldn't have
                the prestige
                that it does.<br><br>Like it or not, programming
                languages are also for people,
                and I suspect the human brain is just as lumpy and
                idiosyncratic
                as the human body. Some ideas are easy for people to
                grasp
                and some aren't. For example, we seem to have a very
                limited
                capacity for dealing with detail. It's this fact that
                makes
                programing languages a good idea in the first place; if
                we
                could handle the detail, we could just program in
                machine
                language.<br><br>Remember, too, that languages are not
                primarily a form for finished programs, but something
                that
                programs have to be developed in. Anyone in the arts
                could
                tell you that you might want different mediums for the
                two situations. Marble, for example, is a nice, durable
                medium for finished ideas, but a hopelessly inflexible
                one
                for developing new ideas.<br><br>A program, like a
                proof,
                is a pruned version of a tree that in the past has had
                false starts branching off all over it. So the test of
                a language is not simply how clean the finished program
                looks
                in it, but how clean the path to the finished program
                was.
                A design choice that gives you elegant finished programs
                may not give you an elegant design process. For example,
                I've written a few macro-defining macros full of nested
                backquotes that look now like little gems, but writing
                them
                took hours of the ugliest trial and error, and frankly,
                I'm still
                not entirely sure they're correct.<br><br>We often act
                as if the test of a language were how good
                finished programs look in it.
                It seems so convincing when you see the same program
                written in two languages, and one version is much
                shorter.
                When you approach the problem from the direction of the
                arts, you're less likely to depend on this sort of
                test. You don't want to end up with a programming
                language like marble.<br><br>For example, it is a huge
                win in developing software to
                have an interactive toplevel, what in Lisp is called a
                read-eval-print loop. And when you have one this has
                real effects on the design of the language. It would not
                work well for a language where you have to declare
                variables before using them, for example. When you're
                just typing expressions into the toplevel, you want to
                be
                able to set x to some value and then start doing things
                to x. You don't want to have to declare the type of x
                first. You may dispute either of the premises, but if
                a language has to have a toplevel to be convenient, and
                mandatory type declarations are incompatible with a
                toplevel, then no language that makes type declarations
                mandatory could be convenient to program
                in.<br><br><br><br>In practice, to get good design you
                have to get close, and stay
                close, to your users. You have to calibrate your ideas
                on actual
                users constantly, especially in the beginning. One of
                the reasons
                Jane Austen's novels are so good is that she read them
                out loud to
                her family. That's why she never sinks into
                self-indulgently arty
                descriptions of landscapes,
                or pretentious philosophizing. (The philosophy's there,
                but it's
                woven into the story instead of being pasted onto it
                like a label.)
                If you open an average "literary" novel and imagine
                reading it out loud
                to your friends as something you'd written, you'll feel
                all too
                keenly what an imposition that kind of thing is upon the
                reader.<br><br>In the software world, this idea is known
                as Worse is Better.
                Actually, there are several ideas mixed together in the
                concept of
                Worse is Better, which is why people are still arguing
                about
                whether worse
                is actually better or not. But one of the main ideas in
                that
                mix is that if you're building something new, you should
                get a
                prototype in front of users as soon as
                possible.<br><br>The alternative approach might be
                called the Hail Mary strategy.
                Instead of getting a prototype out quickly and gradually
                refining
                it, you try to create the complete, finished, product in
                one long
                touchdown pass. As far as I know, this is a
                recipe for disaster. Countless startups destroyed
                themselves this
                way during the Internet bubble. I've never heard of a
                case
                where it worked.<br><br>What people outside the software
                world may not realize is that
                Worse is Better is found throughout the arts.
                In drawing, for example, the idea was discovered during
                the
                Renaissance. Now almost every drawing teacher will tell
                you that
                the right way to get an accurate drawing is not to
                work your way slowly around the contour of an object,
                because errors will
                accumulate and you'll find at the end that the lines
                don't meet.
                Instead you should draw a few quick lines in roughly the
                right place,
                and then gradually refine this initial sketch.<br><br>In
                most fields, prototypes
                have traditionally been made out of different materials.
                Typefaces to be cut in metal were initially designed
                with a brush on paper. Statues to be cast in bronze
                were modelled in wax. Patterns to be embroidered on
                tapestries
                were drawn on paper with ink wash. Buildings to be
                constructed from stone were tested on a smaller scale in
                wood.<br><br>What made oil paint so exciting, when it
                first became popular in the fifteenth century, was that
                you
                could actually make the finished work <i>from</i> the
                prototype.
                You could make a preliminary drawing if you wanted to,
                but you
                weren't held to it; you could work out all the details,
                and
                even make major changes, as you finished the
                painting.<br><br>You can do this in software too. A
                prototype doesn't have to
                be just a model; you can refine it into the finished
                product.
                I think you should always do this when you can. It lets
                you
                take advantage of new insights you have along the way.
                But
                perhaps even more important, it's good for
                morale.<br><br><br><br>Morale is key in design. I'm
                surprised people
                don't talk more about it. One of my first
                drawing teachers told me: if you're bored when you're
                drawing something, the drawing will look boring.
                For example, suppose you have to draw a building, and
                you
                decide to draw each brick individually. You can do this
                if you want, but if you get bored halfway through and
                start
                making the bricks mechanically instead of observing each
                one,
                the drawing will look worse than if you had merely
                suggested
                the bricks.<br><br>Building something by gradually
                refining a prototype is good
                for morale because it keeps you engaged. In software, my
                rule is: always have working code. If you're writing
                something that you'll be able to test in an hour, then
                you
                have the prospect of an immediate reward to motivate
                you.
                The same is true in the arts, and particularly in oil
                painting.
                Most painters start with a blurry sketch and gradually
                refine it.
                If you work this way, then in principle
                you never have to end the day with something that
                actually
                looks unfinished. Indeed, there is even a saying among
                painters: "A painting is never finished, you just stop
                working on it." This idea will be familiar to anyone who
                has worked on software.<br><br>Morale is another reason
                that it's hard to design something
                for an unsophisticated user. It's hard to stay
                interested in
                something you don't like yourself. To make something
                good, you have to be thinking, "wow, this is really
                great,"
                not "what a piece of shit; those fools will love
                it."<br><br>Design means making things for humans. But
                it's not just the
                user who's human. The designer is human
                too.<br><br><br><br>Notice all this time I've been
                talking about "the designer."
                Design usually has to be under the control of a single
                person to
                be any good. And yet it seems to be possible for several
                people
                to collaborate on a research project. This seems to
                me one of the most interesting differences between
                research and
                design.<br><br>There have been famous instances of
                collaboration in the arts,
                but most of them seem to have been cases of molecular
                bonding rather
                than nuclear fusion. In an opera it's common for one
                person to
                write the libretto and another to write the music. And
                during the Renaissance,
                journeymen from northern
                Europe were often employed to do the landscapes in the
                backgrounds of Italian paintings. But these aren't true
                collaborations.
                They're more like examples of Robert Frost's
                "good fences make good neighbors." You can stick
                instances
                of good design together, but within each individual
                project,
                one person has to be in control.<br><br>I'm not saying
                that good design requires that one person think
                of everything. There's nothing more valuable than the
                advice
                of someone whose judgement you trust. But after the
                talking is
                done, the decision about what to do has to rest with one
                person.<br><br>Why is it that research can be done by
                collaborators and
                design can't? This is an interesting question. I don't
                know the answer. Perhaps,
                if design and research converge, the best research is
                also
                good design, and in fact can't be done by collaborators.
                A lot of the most famous scientists seem to have worked
                alone.
                But I don't know enough to say whether there
                is a pattern here. It could be simply that many famous
                scientists
                worked when collaboration was less
                common.<br><br>Whatever the story is in the sciences,
                true collaboration
                seems to be vanishingly rare in the arts. Design by
                committee is a
                synonym for bad design. Why is that so? Is there some
                way to
                beat this limitation?<br><br>I'm inclined to think there
                isn't — that good design requires
                a dictator. One reason is that good design has to
                be all of a piece. Design is not just for humans, but
                for individual humans. If a design represents an idea
                that
                fits in one person's head, then the idea will fit in the
                user's
                head too.<br><br><br><br><b>Related:</b><br><br>
