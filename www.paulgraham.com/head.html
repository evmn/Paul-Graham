                     <article>August 2007<br><br>A good programmer working intensively on his own code can hold it
                        in his mind the way a mathematician holds a problem he's working
                        on. Mathematicians don't answer questions by working them out on
                        paper the way schoolchildren are taught to. They do more in their
                        heads: they try to understand a problem space well enough that they
                        can walk around it the way you can walk around the memory of the
                        house you grew up in. At its best programming is the same. You
                        hold the whole program in your head, and you can manipulate it at
                        will.<br><br>That's particularly valuable at the start of a project, because
                        initially the most important thing is to be able to change what
                        you're doing. Not just to solve the problem in a different way,
                        but to change the problem you're solving.<br><br>Your code is your understanding of the problem
                        you're exploring.
                        So it's only when you have your code in your head that you really
                        understand the problem.<br><br>It's not easy to get a program into your head. If you leave a
                        project for a few months, it can take days to really understand it
                        again when you return to it. Even when you're actively working on
                        a program it can take half an hour to load into your head when you
                        start work each day. And that's in the best case. Ordinary
                        programmers working in typical office conditions never enter this
                        mode. Or to put it more dramatically, ordinary programmers working
                        in typical office conditions never really understand the problems
                        they're solving.<br><br>Even the best programmers don't always have the whole program they're
                        working on loaded into their heads. But there are things you can
                        do to help:<br><br>
                        <ol>
                           <li> <b>Avoid distractions.</b> Distractions are bad for many types of work,
                              but especially bad for programming, because programmers tend to
                              operate at the limit of the detail they can handle.<br><br>The danger of a distraction
                              depends not on how long it is, but
                              on how much it scrambles your brain. A programmer can leave the
                              office and go and get a sandwich without losing the code in his
                              head. But the wrong kind of interruption can wipe your brain
                              in 30 seconds.<br><br>Oddly enough, scheduled distractions may be worse than unscheduled
                              ones. If you know you have a meeting in an hour, you don't even
                              start working on something hard.<br><br>
                           <li> <b>Work in long stretches.</b> Since there's a fixed cost each time
                              you start working on a program, it's more efficient to work in
                              a few long sessions than many short ones. There will of course
                              come a point where you get stupid because you're tired. This
                              varies from person to person. I've heard of people hacking for
                              36 hours straight, but the most I've ever been able to manage
                              is about 18, and I work best in chunks of no more than 12.<br><br>The optimum is not the
                              limit you can physically endure. There's
                              an advantage as well as a cost of breaking up a project. Sometimes
                              when you return to a problem after a rest, you find your unconscious
                              mind has left an answer waiting for you.<br><br>
                           <li> <b>Use succinct languages.</b> More
                              <a href="power.html">powerful</a> programming languages
                              make programs shorter. And programmers seem to think of programs
                              at least partially in the language they're using to write them.
                              The more succinct the language, the shorter the program, and the
                              easier it is to load and keep in your head.<br><br>You can magnify the effect of a
                              powerful language by using a
                              style called bottom-up programming, where you write programs in
                              multiple layers, the lower ones acting as programming languages
                              for those above. If you do this right, you only have to keep
                              the topmost layer in your head.<br><br>
                           <li> <b>Keep rewriting your program.</b> Rewriting a program often yields
                              a cleaner design. But it would have advantages even if it didn't:
                              you have to understand a program completely to rewrite it, so
                              there is no better way to get one loaded into your head.<br><br>
                           <li> <b>Write rereadable code.</b> All programmers know it's good to write
                              readable code. But you yourself are the most important reader.
                              Especially in the beginning; a prototype is a conversation with
                              yourself. And when writing for yourself you have different
                              priorities. If you're writing for other people, you may not
                              want to make code too dense. Some parts of a program may be
                              easiest to read if you spread things out, like an introductory
                              textbook. Whereas if you're writing code to make it easy to reload
                              into your head, it may be best to go for brevity.<br><br>
                           <li> <b>Work in small groups.</b> When you manipulate a program in your
                              head, your vision tends to stop at the edge of the code you own.
                              Other parts you don't understand as well, and more importantly,
                              can't take liberties with. So the smaller the number of
                              programmers, the more completely a project can mutate. If there's
                              just one programmer, as there often is at first, you can do
                              all-encompassing redesigns.<br><br>
                           <li> <b>Don't have multiple people editing the same piece of code.</b> You
                              never understand other people's code as well as your own. No
                              matter how thoroughly you've read it, you've only read it, not
                              written it. So if a piece of code is written by multiple authors,
                              none of them understand it as well as a single author would.<br><br>And of course you
                              can't safely redesign something other people
                              are working on. It's not just that you'd have to ask permission.
                              You don't even let yourself think of such things. Redesigning
                              code with several authors is like changing laws; redesigning
                              code you alone control is like seeing the other interpretation
                              of an ambiguous image.<br><br>If you want to put several people to work on a project,
                              divide
                              it into components and give each to one person.<br><br>
                           <li> <b>Start small.</b> A program gets easier to hold in your head as you
                              become familiar with it. You can start to treat parts as black
                              boxes once you feel confident you've fully explored them. But
                              when you first start working on a project, you're forced to see
                              everything. If you start with too big a problem, you may never
                              quite be able to encompass it. So if you need to write a big,
                              complex program, the best way to begin may not be to write a
                              spec for it, but to write a prototype that solves a subset of
                              the problem. Whatever the advantages of planning, they're often
                              outweighed by the advantages of being able to keep a program in
                              your head.
                        </ol>
                        It's striking how often programmers manage to hit all eight points
                        by accident. Someone has an idea for a new project, but because
                        it's not officially sanctioned, he has to do it in off hours&mdash;which
                        turn out to be more productive because there are no distractions.
                        Driven by his enthusiasm for the new project he works on it for
                        many hours at a stretch. Because it's initially just an
                        experiment, instead of a "production" language he uses a mere
                        "scripting" language&mdash;which is in fact far more powerful. He
                        completely rewrites the program several times; that wouldn't be
                        justifiable for an official project, but this is a labor of love
                        and he wants it to be perfect. And since no one is going to see
                        it except him, he omits any comments except the note-to-self variety.
                        He works in a small group perforce, because he either hasn't told
                        anyone else about the idea yet, or it seems so unpromising that no
                        one else is allowed to work on it. Even if there is a group, they
                        couldn't have multiple people editing the same code, because it
                        changes too fast for that to be possible. And the project starts
                        small because the idea <i>is</i> small at first; he just has some cool
                        hack he wants to try out.<br><br>Even more striking are the number of officially sanctioned
                        projects
                        that manage to do <i>all eight things wrong</i>. In fact, if you look at
                        the way software gets written in most organizations, it's almost
                        as if they were deliberately trying to do things wrong. In a sense,
                        they are. One of the defining qualities of organizations since
                        there have been such a thing is to treat individuals as interchangeable
                        parts. This works well for more parallelizable tasks, like fighting
                        wars. For most of history a well-drilled army of professional
                        soldiers could be counted on to beat an army of individual warriors,
                        no matter how valorous. But having ideas is not very parallelizable.
                        And that's what programs are: ideas.<br><br>It's not merely true that organizations dislike the
                        idea of depending
                        on individual genius, it's a tautology. It's part of the definition
                        of an organization not to. Of our current concept of an organization,
                        at least.<br><br>Maybe we could define a new kind of organization that combined the
                        efforts of individuals without requiring them to be interchangeable.
                        Arguably a market is such a form of organization, though it may be
                        more accurate to describe a market as a degenerate case&mdash;as what
                        you get by default when organization isn't possible.<br><br>Probably the best we'll do is some
                        kind of hack, like making the
                        programming parts of an organization work differently from the rest.
                        Perhaps the optimal solution is for big companies not even to try
                        to develop ideas in house, but simply to
                        <a href="hiring.html">buy</a> them. But regardless
                        of what the solution turns out to be, the first step is to realize
                        there's a problem. There is a contradiction in the very phrase
                        "software company." The two words are pulling in opposite directions.
                        Any good programmer in a large organization is going to be at odds
                        with it, because organizations are designed to prevent what
                        programmers strive for.<br><br>
                        <xa href="gh.html">Good programmers</a> manage to get a lot done anyway.
                           But often it
                           requires practically an act of rebellion against the organizations
                           that employ them. Perhaps it will help if more people understand that the way
                           programmers behave is driven by the demands of the work they do.
                           It's not because they're irresponsible that they work in long binges
                           during which they blow off all other obligations, plunge straight into
                           programming instead of writing specs first, and rewrite code that
                           already works. It's not because they're unfriendly that they prefer
                           to work alone, or growl at people who pop their head in the door
                           to say hello. This apparently random collection of annoying habits
                           has a single explanation: the power of holding a program in one's
                           head.<br><br>Whether or not understanding this can help large organizations, it
                           can certainly help their competitors. The weakest point in big
                           companies is that they don't let individual programmers do great
                           work. So if you're a little startup, this is the place to attack
                           them. Take on the kind of problems that have to be solved in one
                           big brain.<br><br><br><br><br><br>
