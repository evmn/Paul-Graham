   The Syntax Question

will arise more and more, though from the other direction, as 
mainstream languages approach Lisp.)

  <p>
   The idea of introducing Algol-like syntax into Lisp keeps popping up
                      and has seldom failed to create enormous controversy between those who
                      find the universal use of S-expressions a technical advantage (and
                      don't mind the admitted relative clumsiness of S-expressions for
                      numerical expressions) and those who are certain that algebraic syntax
                      is more concise, more convenient, or even more
   <i>
    natural
   </i>
   (whatever
                      that may mean, considering that all these notations are artificial).
  </p>
  <p>
   We conjecture that Algol-style syntax has not really caught on in the
                      Lisp community as a whole for two reasons.  First, there are not
                      enough special symbols to go around.  When your domain of discourse is
                      limited to numbers or characters, there are only so many operations of
                      interest, so it is not difficult to assign one special character to
                      each and be done with it.  But Lisp has a much richer domain of
                      discourse, and a Lisp programmer often approaches an application as
                      yet another exercise in language design; the style typically involves
                      designing new data structures and new functions to operate on
                      them — perhaps dozens or hundreds — and it's too hard to invent that
                      many distinct symbols (though the APL community certainly has tried).
                      Ultimately one must always fall back on a general function-call
                      notation; it's just that Lisp programmers don't wait until they fail.
  </p>
  <p>
   Second, and perhaps more important, Algol-style syntax makes programs
                      look less like the data structures used to represent them.  In a
                      culture where the ability to manipulate representations of programs is
                      a central paradigm, a notation that distances the appearance of a
                      program from the appearance of its representation as data is not
                      likely to be warmly received (and this was, and is, one of the
                      principal objections to the inclusion of
   <tt>
    loop
   </tt>
   in Common Lisp).
  </p>
  <p>
   On the other hand, precisely because Lisp makes it easy to play with
                      program representations, it is always easy for the novice to
                      experiment with alternative notations.  Therefore we expect future
                      generations of Lisp programmers to continue to reinvent Algol-style
                      syntax for Lisp, over and over and over again, and we are equally
                      confident that they will continue, after an initial period of
                      infatuation, to reject it.  (Perhaps this process should be regarded
                      as a rite of passage for Lisp hackers.)
