                        "In
                        Boston
                        they

                        were

                Great cities attract ambitious people. You can sense it
                when you
                walk around one. In a hundred subtle ways, the city
                sends you a
                message: you could do more; you should try
                harder.<br><br>The surprising thing is how
                different these messages can be. New
                York tells you, above all: you should make more money.
                There are
                other messages too, of course. You should be hipper. You
                should
                be better looking. But the clearest message is that you
                should be
                richer.<br><br>What I like about Boston (or rather
                Cambridge) is that the message
                there is: you should be smarter. You really should get
                around to
                reading all those books you've been meaning
                to.<br><br>When you ask what message a city
                sends, you sometimes get surprising
                answers. As much as they respect brains in Silicon
                Valley, the
                message the Valley sends is: you should be more
                powerful.<br><br>That's not quite the
                same message New York sends. Power matters
                in New York too of course, but New York is pretty
                impressed by a
                billion dollars even if you merely inherited it. In
                Silicon Valley
                no one would care except a few real estate agents. What
                matters
                in Silicon Valley is how much effect you have on the
                world. The
                reason people there care about Larry and Sergey is not
                their wealth
                but the fact that they control Google, which affects
                practically
                everyone.<br><br>
                <center>_____</center><br><br>How much does it matter
                what message a city sends?
                Empirically,
                the answer seems to be: a lot. You might think that if
                you had
                enough strength of mind to do great things, you'd be
                able to transcend
                your environment. Where you live should make at most a
                couple
                percent difference. But if you look at the historical
                evidence,
                it seems to matter more than that. Most people who did
                great things
                were clumped together in a few places where that sort of
                thing was
                done at the time.<br><br>You can see how powerful cities
                are from something I wrote
                about
                <a href="taste.html">earlier</a>: the case of the
                Milanese Leonardo.
                Practically every
                fifteenth century Italian painter you've heard of was
                from Florence,
                even though Milan was just as big. People in Florence
                weren't
                genetically different, so you have to assume there was
                someone born
                in Milan with as much natural ability as Leonardo. What
                happened
                to him?<br><br>If even someone with the same natural
                ability as Leonardo
                couldn't beat the force of environment, do you suppose
                you can?<br><br>I don't. I'm
                fairly stubborn, but I wouldn't try to fight this
                force. I'd rather use it. So I've thought a lot about
                where to
                live.<br><br>I'd always imagined Berkeley would be the
                ideal place &mdash; that
                it would basically be Cambridge with good weather. But
                when I
                finally tried living there a couple years ago, it turned
                out not
                to be. The message Berkeley sends is: you should live
                better. Life
                in Berkeley is very civilized. It's probably the place
                in America
                where someone from Northern Europe would feel most at
                home. But
                it's not humming with ambition.<br><br>In retrospect it
                shouldn't have been surprising
                that a place so
                pleasant would attract people interested above all in
                quality of
                life. Cambridge with good weather, it turns out, is not
                Cambridge.
                The people you find in Cambridge are not there by
                accident. You
                have to make sacrifices to live there. It's expensive
                and somewhat
                grubby, and the weather's often bad. So the kind of
                people you
                find in Cambridge are the kind of people who want to
                live where the
                smartest people are, even if that means living in an
                expensive,
                grubby place with bad weather.<br><br>As of this
                writing, Cambridge seems to be the
                intellectual capital
                of the world. I realize that seems a preposterous claim.
                What
                makes it true is that it's more preposterous to claim
                about anywhere
                else. American universities currently seem to be the
                best, judging
                from the flow of ambitious students. And what US city
                has a stronger
                claim? New York? A fair number of smart people, but
                diluted by a
                much larger number of neanderthals in suits. The Bay
                Area has a
                lot of smart people too, but again, diluted; there are
                two great
                universities, but they're far apart. Harvard and MIT are
                practically
                adjacent by West Coast standards, and they're surrounded
                by about
                20 other colleges and universities.

                        </a>]</font><br><br>Cambridge as a result feels
                like a town whose main industry
                is
                ideas, while New York's is finance and Silicon Valley's
                is startups.<br><br>
                <center>_____</center><br><br>When you talk about cities
                in the sense we are, what
                you're really
                talking about is collections of people. For a long time
                cities
                were the only large collections of people, so you could
                use the two
                ideas interchangeably. But we can see how much things
                are changing
                from the examples I've mentioned. New York is a classic
                great city.
                But Cambridge is just part of a city, and Silicon Valley
                is not
                even that. (San Jose is not, as it sometimes claims, the
                capital
                of Silicon Valley. It's just 178 square miles at one end
                of it.)<br><br>Maybe the
                Internet will change things further. Maybe one day the
                most important community you belong to will be a virtual
                one, and
                it won't matter where you live physically. But I
                wouldn't bet on
                it. The physical world is very high bandwidth, and some
                of the
                ways cities send you messages are quite
                subtle.<br><br>One of the exhilarating things
                about coming back to Cambridge every
                spring is walking through the streets at dusk, when you
                can see
                into the houses. When you walk through Palo Alto in the
                evening,
                you see nothing but the blue glow of TVs. In Cambridge
                you see
                shelves full of promising-looking books. Palo Alto was
                probably
                much like Cambridge in 1960, but you'd never guess now
                that there
                was a university nearby. Now it's just one of the richer
                neighborhoods
                in Silicon Valley.

                                <font color=#999999>2</font>
                        </a>]</font><br><br>A city speaks to you mostly
                by accident &mdash; in things
                you see
                through windows, in conversations you overhear. It's not
                something
                you have to seek out, but something you can't turn off.
                One of the
                occupational hazards of living in Cambridge is
                overhearing the
                conversations of people who use interrogative intonation
                in declarative
                sentences. But on average I'll take Cambridge
                conversations over
                New York or Silicon Valley ones.<br><br>A friend who
                moved to Silicon Valley in the late
                90s said the worst
                thing about living there was the low quality of the
                eavesdropping.
                At the time I thought she was being deliberately
                eccentric. Sure,
                it can be interesting to eavesdrop on people, but is
                good quality
                eavesdropping so important that it would affect where
                you chose to
                live? Now I understand what she meant. The conversations
                you
                overhear tell you what sort of people you're
                among.<br><br>
                <center>_____</center><br><br>No matter how determined
                you are, it's hard not to be
                influenced
                by the people around you. It's not so much that you do
                whatever a
                city expects of you, but that you get discouraged when
                no one around
                you cares about the same things you do.<br><br>There's
                an imbalance between
                encouragement and discouragement like
                that between gaining and losing money. Most people
                overvalue
                negative amounts of money: they'll work much harder to
                avoid losing
                a dollar than to gain one. Similarly, although there are
                plenty of
                people strong enough to resist doing something just
                because that's
                what one is supposed to do where they happen to be,
                there are few
                strong enough to keep working on something no one around
                them cares
                about.<br><br>Because ambitions are to some extent
                incompatible and admiration
                is a zero-sum game, each city tends to focus on one type
                of ambition.
                The reason Cambridge is the intellectual capital is not
                just that
                there's a concentration of smart people there, but that
                there's
                nothing <i>else</i> people there care about more.
                Professors in
                New York and the Bay area are second class citizens
                &mdash; till they
                start hedge funds or startups respectively.<br><br>This
                suggests an answer to a question
                people in New York have
                wondered about since the Bubble: whether New York could
                grow into
                a startup hub to rival Silicon Valley. One reason that's
                unlikely
                is that someone starting a startup in New York would
                feel like a
                second class citizen.
                <font color=#999999>[<a href="cities.html#f3n">
                                <font color=#999999>3</font>
                        </a>]</font>
                There's already something else people in New York admire
                more.<br><br>In the long term,
                that could be a bad thing for New York. The power
                of an important new technology does eventually convert
                to money.
                So by caring more about money and less about power than
                Silicon
                Valley, New York is recognizing the same thing, but
                slower.
                <font color=#999999>[<a href="cities.html#f4n">

                        </a>]</font>
                And in fact it has been losing to Silicon Valley at its
                own game:
                the ratio of New York to California residents in the
                Forbes 400 has
                decreased from 1.45 (81:56) when the list was first
                published in
                1982 to .83 (73:88) in 2007.<br><br>
                <center>_____</center><br><br>Not all cities send a
                message. Only those that are centers
                for
                some type of ambition do. And it can be hard to tell
                exactly what
                message a city sends without living there. I understand
                the messages
                of New York, Cambridge, and Silicon Valley because I've
                lived for
                several years in each of them. DC and LA seem to send
                messages
                too, but I haven't spent long enough in either to say
                for sure what
                they are.<br><br>The big thing in LA seems to be fame.
                There's an A List of people
                who are most in demand right now, and what's most
                admired is to be
                on it, or friends with those who are. Beneath that, the
                message is
                much like New York's, though perhaps with more emphasis
                on physical
                attractiveness.<br><br>In DC the message seems to be
                that the most important thing is
                who
                you know. You want to be an insider. In practice this
                seems to
                work much as in LA. There's an A List and you want to be
                on it or
                close to those who are. The only difference is how the A
                List is
                selected. And even that is not that different.<br><br>At
                the moment, San Francisco's
                message seems to be the same as
                Berkeley's: you should live better. But this will change
                if enough
                startups choose SF over the Valley. During the Bubble
                that was a
                predictor of failure &mdash; a self-indulgent choice,
                like buying
                expensive office furniture. Even now I'm suspicious when
                startups
                choose SF. But if enough good ones do, it stops being a
                self-indulgent
                choice, because the center of gravity of Silicon Valley
                will shift
                there.<br><br>I haven't found anything like Cambridge
                for intellectual ambition.
                Oxford and Cambridge (England) feel like Ithaca or
                Hanover: the
                message is there, but not as strong.<br><br>Paris was
                once a great intellectual center.
                If you went there in
                1300, it might have sent the message Cambridge does now.
                But I
                tried living there for a bit last year, and the
                ambitions of the
                inhabitants are not intellectual ones. The message Paris
                sends now
                is: do things with style. I liked that, actually. Paris
                is the
                only city I've lived in where people genuinely cared
                about art. In
                America only a few rich people buy original art, and
                even the more
                sophisticated ones rarely get past judging it by the
                brand name of
                the artist. But looking through windows at dusk in Paris
                you can
                see that people there actually care what paintings look
                like.
                Visually, Paris has the best eavesdropping I know.

                        </a>]</font><br><br>There's one more message
                I've heard from cities: in London
                you can
                still (barely) hear the message that one should be more
                aristocratic.
                If you listen for it you can also hear it in Paris, New
                York, and
                Boston. But this message is everywhere very faint. It
                would have
                been strong 100 years ago, but now I probably wouldn't
                have picked
                it up at all if I hadn't deliberately tuned in to that
                wavelength
                to see if there was any signal left.<br><br>
                <center>_____</center><br><br>So far the complete list
                of messages I've picked up from
                cities is:
                wealth, style, hipness, physical attractiveness, fame,
                political
                power, economic power, intelligence, social class, and
                quality of
                life.<br><br>My immediate reaction to this list is that
                it makes me slightly
                queasy. I'd always considered ambition a good thing, but
                I realize
                now that was because I'd always implicitly understood it
                to mean
                ambition in the areas I cared about. When you list
                everything
                ambitious people are ambitious about, it's not so
                pretty.<br><br>On closer examination I
                see a couple things on the list that are
                surprising in the light of history. For example,
                physical
                attractiveness wouldn't have been there 100 years ago
                (though it
                might have been 2400 years ago). It has always mattered
                for women,
                but in the late twentieth century it seems to have
                started to matter
                for men as well. I'm not sure why &mdash; probably some
                combination
                of the increasing power of women, the increasing
                influence of actors
                as models, and the fact that so many people work in
                offices now:
                you can't show off by wearing clothes too fancy to wear
                in a factory,
                so you have to show off with your body
                instead.<br><br>Hipness is another thing you
                wouldn't have seen on the list 100
                years ago. Or wouldn't you? What it means is to know
                what's what.
                So maybe it has simply replaced the component of social
                class that
                consisted of being "au fait." That could explain why
                hipness seems
                particularly admired in London: it's version 2 of the
                traditional
                English delight in obscure codes that only insiders
                understand.<br><br>Economic power
                would have been on the list 100 years ago, but what
                we mean by it is changing. It used to mean the control
                of vast
                human and material resources. But increasingly it means
                the ability
                to direct the course of technology, and some of the
                people in a
                position to do that are not even rich &mdash; leaders of
                important
                open source projects, for example. The Captains of
                Industry of
                times past had laboratories full of clever people
                cooking up new
                technologies for them. The new breed are themselves
                those people.<br><br>As this force
                gets more attention, another is dropping off the list:
                social class. I think the two changes are related.
                Economic power,
                wealth, and social class are just names for the same
                thing at
                different stages in its life: economic power converts to
                wealth,
                and wealth to social class. So the focus of admiration
                is simply
                shifting upstream.<br><br>
                <center>_____</center><br><br>Does anyone who wants to
                do great work have to live in a
                great city?
                No; all great cities inspire some sort of ambition, but
                they aren't
                the only places that do. For some kinds of work, all you
                need is
                a handful of talented colleagues.<br><br>What cities
                provide is an audience, and a
                funnel for peers. These
                aren't so critical in something like math or physics,
                where no
                audience matters except your peers, and judging ability
                is sufficiently
                straightforward that hiring and admissions committees
                can do it
                reliably. In a field like math or physics all you need
                is a
                department with the right colleagues in it. It could be
                anywhere &mdash; in
                Los Alamos, New Mexico, for example.<br><br>It's in
                fields like the arts or writing or
                technology that the
                larger environment matters. In these the best
                practitioners aren't
                conveniently collected in a few top university
                departments and
                research labs &mdash; partly because talent is harder to
                judge, and
                partly because people pay for these things, so one
                doesn't need to
                rely on teaching or research funding to support oneself.
                It's in
                these more chaotic fields that it helps most to be in a
                great city:
                you need the encouragement of feeling that people around
                you care
                about the kind of work you do, and since you have to
                find peers for
                yourself, you need the much larger intake mechanism of a
                great city.<br><br>You don't
                have to live in a great city your whole life to benefit
                from it. The critical years seem to be the early and
                middle ones
                of your career. Clearly you don't have to grow up in a
                great city.
                Nor does it seem to matter if you go to college in one.
                To most
                college students a world of a few thousand people seems
                big enough.
                Plus in college you don't yet have to face the hardest
                kind of
                work &mdash; discovering new problems to
                solve.<br><br>It's when you move on to the next
                and much harder step that it helps
                most to be in a place where you can find peers and
                encouragement.
                You seem to be able to leave, if you want, once you've
                found both.
                The Impressionists show the typical pattern: they were
                born all
                over France (Pissarro was born in the Carribbean) and
                died all over
                France, but what defined them were the years they spent
                together
                in Paris.<br><br>
                <center>_____</center><br><br>Unless you're sure what
                you want to do and where the
                leading center
                for it is, your best bet is probably to try living in
                several
                places when you're young. You can never tell what
                message a city
                sends till you live there, or even whether it still
                sends one.
                Often your information will be wrong: I tried living in
                Florence
                when I was 25, thinking it would be an art center, but
                it turned
                out I was 450 years too late.<br><br>Even when a city is
                still a live center of
                ambition, you won't know
                for sure whether its message will resonate with you till
                you hear
                it. When I moved to New York, I was very excited at
                first. It's
                an exciting place. So it took me quite a while to
                realize I just
                wasn't like the people there. I kept searching for the
                Cambridge
                of New York. It turned out it was way, way uptown: an
                hour uptown
                by air.<br><br>Some people know at 16 what sort of work
                they're going to do, but
                in most ambitious kids, ambition seems to precede
                anything specific
                to be ambitious about. They know they want to do
                something great.
                They just haven't decided yet whether they're going to
                be a rock
                star or a brain surgeon. There's nothing wrong with
                that. But it
                means if you have this most common type of ambition,
                you'll probably
                have to figure out where to live by trial and error.
                You'll
                probably have to find the city where you feel at home to
                know what sort of
                ambition you
                have.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Notes</b><br><br>[<a name="f1n">

                This is one of the advantages of not having the
                universities
                in your country controlled by the government. When
                governments
                decide how to allocate resources, political deal-making
                causes
                things to be spread out geographically. No central
                goverment would
                put its two best universities in the same town, unless
                it was the
                capital (which would cause other problems). But scholars
                seem to
                like to cluster together as much as people in any other
                field, and

                How many times have you read about startup founders who
                continued
                to live inexpensively as their companies took off? Who
                continued
                to dress in jeans and t-shirts, to drive the old car
                they had in
                grad school, and so on? If you did that in New York,
                people would
                treat you like shit. If you walk into a fancy restaurant
                in San
                Francisco wearing a jeans and a t-shirt, they're nice to
                you; who
                knows who you might be? Not in New York.<br><br>One sign
                of a city's potential as a
                technology center is the number
                of restaurants that still require jackets for men.
                According to
                Zagat's there are none in San Francisco, LA, Boston, or
                Seattle,
                4 in DC, 6 in Chicago, 8 in London, 13 in New York, and
                20 in Paris.<br><br>(Zagat's
                lists the Ritz Carlton Dining Room in SF as requiring
                jackets

                fact they
                don't. Apparently there's only one restaurant left on
                the entire West

                Ideas are one step upstream from economic power, so it's
                conceivable that intellectual centers like Cambridge
                will one day
                have an edge over Silicon Valley like the one the Valley
                has over
                New York.<br><br>This seems unlikely at the moment; if
                anything Boston is falling
                further and further behind. The only reason I even
                mention the
                possibility is that the path from ideas to startups has
                recently
                been getting smoother. It's a lot easier now for a
                couple of hackers
                with no business experience to start a startup than it
                was 10 years
                ago. If you extrapolate another 20 years, maybe the
                balance of
                power will start to shift back. I wouldn't bet on it,
                but I wouldn't
                bet against it either.<br><br>[<a name="f5n">

                If Paris is where people care most about art, why is New
                York
                the center of gravity of the art business? Because in
                the twentieth
                century, art as brand split apart from art as stuff. New
                York is
                where the richest buyers are, but all they demand from
                art is brand,
                and since you can base brand on anything with a
                sufficiently
                identifiable style, you may as well use the local
                stuff.<br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to
