   These emails are from the day we got Viaweb working.  I think 
we demoed it to potential investors a few days later.

   <!-- In 1995, what are now called online stores were usually called 
"catalogs."  We made a conscious decision to switch to the word 
"store" in December, guessing (correctly) that a shorter name would 
win. -->

   I have clisp installed, and it has a (shell "...") command.

   The sink works now.

   It loads now. It's running (gen-site)... I think I'll get some coffee.

   About an hour ago we got the generator working remotely.  That
is, you can now run the generator at our site from Netscape,
wherever you happen to be.
  </p>
  <p>
   --&gt; If you were a catalog company, yesterday there were about five
    places that could generate a web catalog for you.  Now anyone
    with a modem and a copy of Netscape can do it.
  </p>
  <p>
   To use the program, all you have to do is go to a certain URL
at www.webgen.com.  This page has a form you can type commands
into to run the generator.  When it has finished, you can inspect
your changed catalog by going to its URL.
  </p>
  <p>
   We now have to do a lot of polishing: the program is very slow
and not especially user-friendly.  But it is a real, working system,
and it already generates the best catalogs on the Web.
  </p>
  <p>
   We are thinking of having the service go online for real around
the beginning of September.  Between now and then we might like
to use you as a guinea-pig, Gino.  Actually, we should have
Julian generate a catalog of his own, too.
