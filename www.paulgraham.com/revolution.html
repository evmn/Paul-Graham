        <article>April 2009<br><br>Recently I realized I'd been holding
                two ideas in my head that would explode if
                combined.<br><br>The first is that startups may
                represent a <a href="highres.html">new economic
                        phase</a>, on the scale of the Industrial
                Revolution. I'm not sure of this, but there seems a
                decent chance it's true. People are dramatically more
                <nota href="wealth.html">productive</a> as founders or
                        early employees of startups&mdash;imagine how
                        much less Larry and Sergey would have achieved
                        if they'd gone to work for a big
                        company&mdash;and that scale of improvement can
                        change social customs.<br><br>The second idea is
                        that startups are a type of business that
                        flourishes in certain places that <a href="startuphubs.html">specialize</a>
                        in it&mdash;that Silicon Valley specializes in
                        startups in the same way Los Angeles specializes
                        in movies, or New York in finance. <font color=#999999>[<a href="revolution.html#f1n">
                                        <font color=#999999>1</font>
                                </a>]</font><br><br>What if both are
                        true? What if startups are both a new economic
                        phase and also a type of business that only
                        flourishes in certain centers?<br><br>If so,
                        this revolution is going to be particularly
                        revolutionary. All previous revolutions have
                        spread. Agriculture, cities, and
                        industrialization all spread widely. If startups
                        end up being like the movie business, with just
                        a handful of centers and one dominant one,
                        that's going to have novel
                        consequences.<br><br>There are already signs
                        that startups may not spread particularly well.
                        The spread of startups seems to be proceeding
                        slower than the spread of the Industrial
                        Revolution, despite the fact that communication
                        is so much faster now.<br><br>Within a few
                        decades of the founding of Boulton & Watt there
                        were steam engines scattered over northern
                        Europe and North America. Industrialization
                        didn't spread much beyond those regions for a
                        while. It only spread to places where there was
                        a strong middle class&mdash;countries where a
                        private citizen could make a fortune without
                        having it confiscated. Otherwise it wasn't worth
                        investing in factories. But in a country with a
                        strong middle class it was easy for industrial
                        techniques to take root. An individual mine or
                        factory owner could decide to install a steam
                        engine, and within a few years he could probably
                        find someone local to make him one. So steam
                        engines spread fast. And they spread widely,
                        because the locations of mines and factories
                        were determined by features like rivers,
                        harbors, and sources of raw materials.
                        <font color=#999999>[<a href="revolution.html#f2n">
                                        <font color=#999999>2</font>
                                </a>]</font><br><br>Startups don't seem
                        to spread so well, partly because they're more a
                        social than a technical phenomenon, and partly
                        because they're not tied to geography. An
                        individual European manufacturer could import
                        industrial techniques and they'd work fine. This
                        doesn't seem to work so well with startups: you
                        need a community of expertise, as you do in the
                        movie business. <font color=#999999>[<a href="revolution.html#f3n">
                                        <font color=#999999>3</font>
                                </a>]</font>
                        Plus there aren't the same forces driving
                        startups to spread. Once railroads or electric
                        power grids were invented, every region had to
                        have them. An area without railroads or power
                        was a rich potential market. But this isn't true
                        with startups. There's no need for a Microsoft
                        of France or Google of
                        Germany.<br><br>Governments may decide they want
                        to encourage startups locally, but government
                        policy can't call them into being the way a
                        genuine need could.<br><br>How will this all
                        play out? If I had to predict now, I'd say that
                        startups will spread, but very slowly, because
                        their spread will be driven not by government
                        policies (which won't work) or by market need
                        (which doesn't exist) but, to the extent that it
                        happens at all, by the same random factors that
                        have caused startup culture to spread thus far.
                        And such random factors will increasingly be
                        outweighed by the pull of existing startup
                        hubs.<br><br>Silicon Valley is where it is
                        because William Shockley wanted to move back to
                        Palo Alto, where he grew up, and the experts he
                        lured west to work with him liked it so much
                        they stayed. Seattle owes much of its position
                        as a tech center to the same cause: Gates and
                        Allen wanted to move home. Otherwise Albuquerque
                        might have Seattle's place in the rankings.
                        Boston is a tech center because it's the
                        intellectual capital of the US and probably the
                        world. And if Battery Ventures hadn't turned
                        down Facebook, Boston would be significantly
                        bigger now on the startup radar
                        screen.<br><br>But of course it's not a
                        coincidence that Facebook got funded in the
                        Valley and not Boston. There are more and bolder
                        investors in Silicon Valley than in Boston, and
                        even undergrads know it.<br><br>Boston's case
                        illustrates the difficulty you'd have
                        establishing a new startup hub this late in the
                        game. If you wanted to create a startup hub by
                        reproducing the way existing ones happened, the
                        <a href="siliconvalley.html">way to do it</a>
                        would be to establish a first-rate research
                        university in a place so nice that rich people
                        wanted to live there. Then the town would be
                        hospitable to both groups you need: both
                        founders and investors. That's the combination
                        that yielded Silicon Valley. But Silicon Valley
                        didn't have Silicon Valley to compete with. If
                        you tried now to create a startup hub by
                        planting a great university in a nice place, it
                        would have a harder time getting started,
                        because many of the best startups it produced
                        would be sucked away to existing startup
                        hubs.<br><br>Recently I suggested a potential
                        shortcut:
                        <a href="maybe.html">pay startups to move</a>.
                        Once you had enough good startups in one place,
                        it would create a self-sustaining chain
                        reaction. Founders would start to move there
                        without being paid, because that was where their
                        peers were, and investors would appear too,
                        because that was where the deals were.<br><br>In
                        practice I doubt any government would have the
                        balls to try this, or the brains to do it right.
                        I didn't mean it as a practical suggestion, but
                        more as an exploration of the lower bound of
                        what it would take to create a startup hub
                        deliberately.<br><br>The most likely scenario is
                        (1) that no government will successfully
                        establish a startup hub, and (2) that the spread
                        of startup culture will thus be driven by the
                        random factors that have driven it so far, but
                        (3) that these factors will be increasingly
                        outweighed by the pull of existing startup hubs.
                        Result: this revolution, if it is one, will be
                        unusually localized.<br><br><br><br><br><br>

                        There are two very different types of startup:
                        one kind that evolves naturally, and one kind
                        that's called into being to "commercialize" a
                        scientific discovery. Most computer/software
                        startups are now the first type, and most
                        pharmaceutical startups the second. When I talk
                        about startups in this essay, I mean type I
                        startups. There is no difficulty making type II
                        startups spread: all you have to do is fund
                        medical research labs; commercializing whatever
                        new discoveries the boffins throw off is as
                        straightforward as building a new airport. Type
                        II startups neither require nor produce startup
                        culture. But that means having type II startups
                        won't get you type I startups. Philadelphia is a
                        case in point: lots of type II startups, but
                        hardly any type I.<br><br>Incidentally, Google
                        may appear to be an instance of a type II
                        startup, but it wasn't. Google is not pagerank
                        commercialized. They could have used another
                        algorithm and everything would have turned out
                        the same. What made Google Google is that they
                        cared about doing search well at a critical
                        point in the evolution of the web.<br><br>[<a name="f2n">
                                <font color=#000000>2</font>

                        Watt didn't invent the steam engine. His
                        critical invention was a refinement that made
                        steam engines dramatically more efficient: the
                        separate condenser. But that oversimplifies his
                        role. He had such a different attitude to the
                        problem and approached it with such energy that
                        he transformed the field. Perhaps the most
                        accurate way to put it would be to say that Watt
                        reinvented the steam engine.<br><br>[<a name="f3n">

                        The biggest counterexample here is Skype. If
                        you're doing
                        something that would get shut down in the US, it
                        becomes an
                        advantage to be located elsewhere. That's why
                        Kazaa took
                        the place of Napster. And the expertise and
                        connections the
                        founders gained from running Kazaa helped ensure
                        the success
                        of Skype.<br><br><b>Thanks</b> to Patrick
