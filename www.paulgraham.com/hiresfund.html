                September 2010<br><br>The reason startups have been
                using
                <a href="http://twitter.com/paulg/status/22319113993">more
                        convertible notes</a> in angel
                rounds is that they make deals close faster. By making
                it easier
                for startups to give different prices to different
                investors, they
                help them break the sort of deadlock that happens when
                investors
                all wait to see who else is going to invest.<br><br>By
                far the biggest influence on investors' opinions of a
                startup
                is the opinion of other investors. There are very, very
                few who
                simply decide for themselves. Any startup founder can
                tell you the
                most common question they hear from investors is not
                about the
                founders or the product, but "who else is
                investing?"<br><br>That tends to produce deadlocks.
                Raising an old-fashioned
                fixed-size equity round can take weeks, because all the
                angels sit around
                waiting for the others to commit, like competitors in a
                bicycle
                sprint who deliberately ride slowly at the start so they
                can follow
                whoever breaks first.<br><br>Convertible notes let
                startups beat such deadlocks by rewarding
                investors willing to move first with lower (effective)
                valuations.
                Which they deserve because they're taking more risk.
                It's much
                safer to invest in a startup Ron Conway has already
                invested in;
                someone who comes after him should pay a higher
                price.<br><br>The reason convertible notes allow more
                flexibility in price is
                that valuation caps aren't actual valuations, and notes
                are cheap
                and easy to do. So you can do high-resolution
                fundraising: if you
                wanted you could have a separate note with a different
                cap for each
                investor.<br><br>That cap need not simply rise
                monotonically. A startup could
                also give better deals to investors they expected to
                help
                them most. The point is simply that different investors,
                whether because of the help they offer or their
                willingness to
                commit, have different values for
                startups, and their terms should reflect
                that.<br><br>Different terms for different investors is
                clearly the way of the future. Markets always evolve
                toward higher
                resolution. You may not need to use convertible notes to
                do it.
                With sufficiently lightweight standardized equity terms
                (and some
                changes in investors' and lawyers' expectations about
                equity rounds)
                you might be able to do the same thing with equity
                instead of debt.
                Either would be fine with startups, so long as they can
                easily
                change their valuation.<br><br>Deadlocks weren't the
                only problem with fixed-size equity rounds.
                Another was that startups had to decide in advance how
                much to
                raise. I think it's a mistake for a startup to fix upon
                a specific
                number. If investors are easily convinced, the startup
                should raise more
                now, and if investors are skeptical, the startup should
                take a
                smaller amount and use that to get the company to the
                point where
                it's more convincing.<br><br>It's just not reasonable to
                expect startups to pick an optimal round
                size in advance, because that depends on the reactions
                of investors,
                and those are impossible to predict.<br><br>Fixed-size,
                multi-investor angel rounds are such a bad idea for
                startups that one wonders why things were ever done that
                way. One
                possibility is that this custom reflects the way
                investors like to
                collude when they can get away with it. But I think the
                actual
                explanation is less sinister. I think angels (and their
                lawyers)
                organized rounds this way in unthinking imitation of VC
                series A
                rounds. In a series A, a fixed-size equity round with a
                lead makes
                sense, because there is usually just one big investor,
                who is
                unequivocally the lead. Fixed-size series A rounds
                already are
                high res. But the more investors you have in a round,
                the less
                sense it makes for everyone to get the same
                price.<br><br>The most interesting question here may be
                what high res fundraising
                will do to the world of investors. Bolder investors will
                now get
                rewarded with lower prices. But more important, in a
                hits-driven business, is that they'll be able to get
                into the deals
                they want. Whereas the "who else is investing?" type of
                investors
                will not only pay higher prices, but may not be able to
                get into
                the best deals at
                all.<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><b>Thanks</b> to
