  <h1>
   Labels
  </h1>
  <p>
   January 2004
  </p>
  <p>
   A friend asked me to give some examples of labels
used to
   <a href="say.html">
    suppress ideas
   </a>
   .
I started searching, and the list grew and grew.
  </p>
  <p>
   Most of the terms listed below were found online, in laws, 
regulations, acceptable use policies,
the codes of conduct of schools, universities, businesses, and
government agencies, descriptions of web filter criteria, and articles
about censorship.  
It was depressing reading,
rather like all the spams I used to read before I tried
writing
   <a href="spam.html">
    statistical
   </a>
   filters.
  </p>
  <p>
   <!--Instead of getting inside
the mind of the spammer, I was getting inside the mind of the censor.
(It was cleaner in there, but very cramped.)
-->
   I've tried to include
   <i>
    every
   </i>
   label used to criticize statements
in the past 100 years
except truly neutral ones like false, untrue, mistaken, etc.
So there are of course contradictions.  For example, some web filters 
forbid access to web sites mentioning homosexuality, whereas many university 
speech codes forbid remarks critical of it.
  </p>
  <p>
   I've only included labels used in the English-speaking world, which
unfortunately excludes the marvellous efflorescence in 
the Soviet Union and China during the twentieth century.
  </p>
  <p>
   The most interesting thing I found was the
   <a href="http://www.artsreformation.com/a001/hays-code.html">
    Hays Code
   </a>
   , 
which  controlled the American movie industry from 1930 to 1966.
What a piece of work.  I had no idea that it
forbade, for example, the depiction of racially mixed couples.
  </p>
  <p>
   Another surprise: I found these labels included some words that I
myself use: "unscientific", for example.  
Is it wrong to call something unscientific?  I think it can be.
Labels are lazy.  It is not enough merely to label an idea as
unscientific, or any of the other terms below.  One ought to
provide more detail.
  </p>
  <p>
   If you made a graph representing which of these words occurred
together, I think you'd find the central node was the one 
representing "inappropriate".  That seems the most general (and thus
least meaningful) label at the moment. As far as I can tell,
it is little more than a five-syllable synonym for "bad".
